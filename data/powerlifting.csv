71rnks,1506093506.0,I Invented a Deadlift Product - Converts hex plates into round plates,"I just launched my Kickstarter project called [HexBumper] (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/348065710/hexbumper-convert-hex-plates-into-round-bumper-pla?ref=coptpm)! Only been live a few days.

I dealt with hex plates at a variety of fitness clubs for years. Finding out that enough people also encountered this problem, I designed something that solves it. HexBumper converts the 12-sided shape of the hex plates into a completely round plate. This prevents the bar from shifting around during deadlift sets. If you have hex plates at your gym, I encourage you to try this. If you know someone that does, they would really appreciate this.

Worked pretty hard on this so I wanted to share it with you all. Thanks again I look forward to hearing back from you guys.

EDIT: Thanks for the support guys. Feel free to share this with friends or others you think could use it!
*To answer some FAQs*
Weight: about 4.4 lbs for one set (2.2 lbs for each side of the barbell)
Bar height: less than 1"" raised when applied to hex plates

EDIT UPDATE: I have since done a durability test with a local powerlifter who pulls a 1RM over 700 lbs. He really likes my product at well so gave them a shot. He tried with HexBumpers today 9/24/17 for the following: Sets of 5 Reps up to 315 lbs. Sets of 1-3 rep up to **650 lbs**. This is with my **prototype** and the Kickstarter production will be even stronger. Maintained integrity and easily held the weight with force striking the ground. Hope this answers questions about its strength! One set will be all most people ever need.

44wvgh,1455027920.0,Serious Post About Drug Use,"What's up guys? I contemplated posting this for a number of reasons but I think if sharing my experience can help one guy see a better way then it's worth it. Anyone that knows me knows I'm an extremist, and would do anything to be the best that I can be. I've taken every known drug that I could get my hands on to improve strength. I've taken doses that I look back at, and it makes no sense, honestly no sense because what I was taking, or the combinations would often times be no good together. I just used whatever, whenever. For lack of a better term I was addicted. Not physically of course, but mentally to a ""more is better mindset"". Many many lifters go through this.

I sit here at 33 years old a month removed from some of the best lifts of my life. ALL I was taking during that time was 300 mgs Test Cypionate, 300 mgs Test Propionate, 300 mgs EQ, and I took some Halo the night before, and morning of... 20 mgs each. No DBol, No Anadrol... I'm not telling you those things don't work, but often times the benefits are masked by the negatives. So many times I've lost my appetite, mood was shitty and so on. I think taking them for a week- 10 days to give you a boost before a comp is ideal before the bad sides can set in. Also that being said I got my hands on REAL punch tab Russian made Dianabol and 20 mgs was ALL I needed. I hear doses, fuck I've done 100 mgs a day of Dbol and Anadrol. There's no way it was real once I tried to punch tabs. 

Same for my test. I got with a hormone Doctor that actually gave a shit, and why wouldn't you? It's basically legal protection to continue a healthy pursuit of a sport you love. I get 250 mgs of Cypionate x 2 times per week. And this is far better than when I was running 1000+ of much of the stuff floating around the market. 

Now I'm not sitting here trying to tell you some bs or that steroids don't help, they do. But what I'm trying to say is that maybe all those years of crazy doses were just me being lazy, and taking an easy road? I've always trained hard but only in the last couple of years have I really dedicated to nutrition and hydration, and it's made a huge huge improvement.

To give you guys an example I was 340 when I fell, my resting pulse was 110, and my BP was 170's/110's. I'm 3-4 weeks removed from some of the best, and strongest lifts of my life, and my BP has consistently 130's/80's, my pulse is now around 80, and my bodyweight is 315 as of this morning. I'm running 500 mgs Testosterone Cypionate, and 4-6ius daily of HGH as prescribed to me by my HRT Doctor. I also use TB500 and BPC-157 to promote tendon healing/strength but will be switching to Anavar in the 20-40 mg range per day for the same reason. Anavar, REAL Anavar is amazing. 

I hope this helps some of you guys out, I go to comps and I see the bloat, and red faces, and while I get it, I've been there, I've also learned there's maybe a better way to the same destination.

While they work physically, they can become boring over time and tiring mentally. Hopefully these (What I hope are extensive) charts can help out more upper intermediate to advanced lifters with exercise selections for both overcoming weaknesses and introducing a little more variety. 

Similar to other chart's you've seen in the past (there's only so many ways to word such a chart) I've separated each lift into 2-3 different weak points and 3 different ways of increasing your performance in each lift. While there may be nothing new introduced in these charts for some of you, I hope that these are some of the most extensive exercise selection charts that you've come across and allow you to have some place to come back to when selecting a new program/cycle (Extensive while still being specific enough to your lifts and having carryover). 

I've split up each lift to be divided into:

**strengthening the zone**, **Potential weak muscles & Strengthening Weak muscles**, and **acceleration exercises**

-weighs 83kg or less
-19 years old or under 
-pulls sumo and wears deadlift socks
-benches with an arch big enough their glutes aren’t on the bench  
-always seems to have a USAPL Raw total world record flexed in the bio
-does box jumps to “maintain athleticism”

*The Compensator*
-Pulls conventional and makes it known

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out. 

  

---

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)** Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many of the readers here in /r/weightroom are firmly in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.",powerlifting,"OVERTRAINED: 50 consecutive days of Benching 345-465+ pounds for 900+ reps... without a single face-pull I originally posted this to /r/weightroom, but was asked to share it here as well, this was my experience training bench with extreme frequency, it's how ***I PERSONALLY *** went about things, and the bits I learned.

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out.

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)** Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many of the readers here in /r/weightroom are firmly in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up."

8jyxz2,1526508179.0,How to Write a Hypertrophy cycle,"I'm seeing this a lot on the sub and figured I'd layout a simple template to use for beginners who hear building muscle is great but don't know that there are more rep ranges than 5 and more sets than 3.

**How to Write a Hypertrophy Block**

A. How long is the block going to be?


Are you going to do 12,10,8,6 weeks? This decides what your progression will be like. Progression on 12 weeks can be slower than progression on 6 weeks. You can also extend a 6 week into a 12 week by running a week twice, making a small adjustment in sets or weight on the 2nd week.

So a week 1 4x12 at 50% can be a 5x12 at 50% or a 4x12 at 52.5/55% on week 2. Easy way to stretch a program.

B. What equipment do I have available?


The more bars, machines, etc you have available the more you can vary variations and accessory work from week to week. Again you can double up and make writing the program easier by doing a block of accessories for 2 weeks rather than changing it every week.

For example day 1 has: glute ham raise 4x10, lunges 4x10, plank 4x30 seconds, and kb swings 4x20. You can run that for 2 weeks then make week 3 accessories different like: reverse hyper 4x8, step up 4x12, split squat 4x10, hanging leg raise 4x10. Then run that again for week 4 and rinse, repeat ad infinitum. 

C. What muscles do I need to bring up?


What sucks? Your back, your arms, your chest, your quads, your hammies, your traps, your everything? Tailor the accessories for you. Chase the pump and grow some muscle. 

D. What’s my work capacity like?


Can you do sets of 15-20 reps? Can you only do sets of 10-12 reps? Only sets of 5? If you can’t do the high rep sets you should start there. That’s low hanging fruit and proof your work capacity sucks. Hypertrophy=reps, reps, reps, pump, reps, pump, reps. Stop doing 3x5s and calling it hypertrophy. It’s not. 

E. Figure out how many days you want to train


I like to start off blocks around the 100 rep mark in a day for each movement (squat, bench, dl) if it's 1 day a week frequency, if there's more frequency you can do a bit more. Try not to start too high were you're thrashed the whole training cycle. Build into it. If I want to train squats 2x a week, bench 3x a week, dl 2x a week that overall rep count is going to be different than if I was just doing 1 day each frequency. So you can either split reps up amongst the days of the week evenly or make a day more squat focused or dl focused and the put the rest of the rep volume that’s leftover on a lighter day for that movement.  So an example on squat at 1 day a week would be

Squat 4x12= 48 reps

Front squat 3x8 = 24 reps

Box squat 3x10=  30 for  102 reps for the day on squatting movements + accessory work

On 2x a week squatting you could do a 5x12 on day 1 with either front squat after or save front squats and boxes for day 2. Similar to accessory work you can double weeks up just changing the percentages slightly or adding a set to extend a program. 

You can get fancy and try to do an undulating model but linear periodization is easy to setup and adjust and you’re here to build muscle not flex your fingers on the spreadsheet. Effort and work are the objectives during a hyp block. It doesn’t need to be complicated to work. Just add 2.5-5% to each main movement week to week. Or do a set one week and a percentage increase the next week. The slower the progression the more sustainable the training. If you start at 12 you can go to 10s then 8s then 6s then 5s, then cycle back up or turn that into 8 weeks by doubling up each week by adding a set or jumping 2.5% in intensity. 

**Final Thoughts**

Don’t be scared about getting away from heavier weights. The strength will be there when you transition back to a strength block. Focus on size and chasing the pump. Make it hard, increase your work capacity. That’s the base of your pyramid you’re building to peak off of. Eat some food, chase a pump, and grow.

7hhvk0,1512400161.0,Open Powerlifting: The All-Inclusive Free Powerlifting Database,"TL;DR: Check out [openpowerlifting.org](http://www.openpowerlifting.org) (on a desktop!) to see where you stand as a powerlifter. Post below to get your Instagram tagged.

The r/powerlifting moderators have extremely generously added a link to the [Open Powerlifting](http://www.openpowerlifting.org) project to the subreddit's sidebar. Although I've mentioned the project on-and-off here, they also offered that we could make a post explaining what we're doing and why it matters.

Open Powerlifting is a project to archive powerlifting results and enter that complete database into the public domain. Our sport is fragmented into a number of different federations, each of which maintains its own division records, and each of which stores its meet results independently of all the others. That makes it basically impossible to search through the meet results to get a good overview of the sport as a whole.

The result is that powerlifting doesn't really have accurate data like in mainstream sports. In football, you can look up player stats; but do you know your powerlifting stats? Even in Crossfit, you can look up how your Fran time compares to competitors all over the world; but how did your Deadlift compare?

There have been some attempts at making this database, but they are either behind paywalls (and therefore bad for growing the sport) and/or are woefully incomplete (because of outdated technological choices and an inability to cope with the tremendous amount of work required).

We've spent the past three years and thousands of hours archiving and standardizing meet data, and have built a free site where you can answer those questions and get a complete picture of our sport: the [Open Powerlifting Lifter Rankings](http://www.openpowerlifting.org). You can use the controls at the top of the page to look at results only in certain federations, only in certain weightclasses, with the equipment of your choice, and you can narrow the results to only include lifts done in 2017. You can change the sorting by clicking on ""Squat"", ""Bench"", ""Deadlift"", ""Total"", or ""Wilks"". It's basically a huge spreadsheet at the moment, so it's recommended to use a device with a large monitor, like a desktop or a laptop.

The site was built by a team of Redditors, and we've relied on community feedback for basically every major decision we've made. Our hope is that the choices made by the site represent the intentions of the general powerlifting community as a whole.

2017 was a huge growth year for us (the project is three years old!) -- in addition to standing up the current website, our volunteer staff grew to 8 team members, and our new social media coordinator started [an Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/openpowerlifting) where we hope to give lifters more publicity by calling out their achievements.

In 2018, thanks to generous donations, we now have the means to stand up a server and rewrite the site for mobile, and generally do a better job at making it easy to find the results you'd want to look for.

If you've competed in powerlifting, you should be on the site already. If you have an Instagram, post below and we'll tag it to your name -- that way, your competitors can look you up from meet results. If you have some meets that aren't in the database yet, post below and we'll add them ASAP. If you think you might be interested in helping out with the project, post below and I'll send you a link to the team Slack chat.

If you like the site, please tell people about it! We have zero advertising budget, and rely solely on word-of-mouth. More people looking at the site means more errors corrected, which means that the powerlifting archive will be ever-more accurate.

2018 is going to be a huge year for powerlifting, and we're so thankful for this community's generosity and support in letting us contribute to that.

ex9mi8,1580578662.0,[Online Coaching Review] Cody Lefever (GZCL),"Hello all,

This will be my honest input about the online coaching service with Cody, i know he have a lot of positive feedback in this community but this was my experience and so i feel that i need to make sure nobody goes through it as well.

**Background:** 

I am a semi-competitive powerlifter in the -90kg category and i wanted to up my game, since i do believe i have the necessary will and power but lack a lot of knowledge and needed somebody to check essentially my form, since i tend to have a very very miserable form.  
So i looked for a Online Coach and that will be the first Coach i ever had.

&#x200B;

**1st Cody Contact:**

I research on this reddit a lot of coaches and one that was talked a lot of good things (and not overly priced) was Cody Lefever. I contacted him for a Coach Inquiry, explained that essentially i needed form checks and if he offered that service. Cody explained that he got two price tags (for respect for him will not mention any price in here) one more complete package lets say and other with less point of contact and that will take more time to answer the client (about 3 days max.). In honesty i explained Cody that unfortunately this price was a little bit high for my wallet, but since i heard so many good things about him i will go for the lower price plan, he answered that we would **OFFER** me for the same price of the lower package EVERYTHING from the bigger package, except for the answer frame, that could be longer (3days max.) i accepted and we started to work together  


**1st Month:**

He send me a plan based on my needs and ask me to record video of the main lifts, 1st and last set. We make some adjustment based on my injuries (i have a pinch on my right shoulder so any incline movements are forbidden for me). He asked me to send videos by Instagram, so i did it. The videos were only seen after like 1 week or so, and he started to mention that he got some issues with his intagram app on his phone since it worked bad and did not send any notifications. I understood and started to make a weekly review of my week in a youtube video and send it over the links. I send about 5 videos per week (only in 1 email to avoid disturbing too much) and the answers were basically, good speed, try to be quicker, explode more (i think that is not any kind of form check...) but ok i continue with him since i was trusting the process and believe that he would need to have more videos and more data to provide a more clear form check.  


**2nd Month:**

So we jumped to the second month, he asked me if we could continue with the same schema and workout since he was seeing some improvements, of course i agree and basically i receive for the second month the same sheet (with minor tweaks only). Before anything that is **NOT INCORRECT** as in order to see improvements you cannot only dedicate 4 weeks into something and then switch. So it was ok and i agree, but Cody forgot again to remove the incline work and other stuff i explained that he don't have the equipment for, so i changed the sheet and explained him, he told me he forgot it (today i believe he don't even have cared but ok). So second month i was sending videos, got no answers outside good one, explode more. I even ask him if he didn't wanted any other angles video for more analysis has i may was lacking something and already giving the hint i was missing something from this Online Coaching. He answered yes you can record more angles... This was when i started to think something was not correct, so i was paying to somebody to help me i was doing his job, he should be the one asked my things so we can work together... But it could be a phase so i give another shot into month 3.

&#x200B;

**3rd Month:**

This was in Holidays season and i asked Cody since my gym closes for a lot of days the following. I would use this week opportunity to make a small deload and near the the end of the week try a PR that i wanted a lot (300kgs Deadlift, i missed near the lockout but 2020 gonna be the year i promise hehe), so i requested Cody this opportunity and to make sure this will not affect him i pay the upcoming month in the same day and told him no need to rush sending the training plan over the weekend, i only need it for the week after, send it when you can. 

Also since it was new year's eve and again the gym will be closed for a couple of days i requested the first week to only make a plan for 4 days (i train 6 normally). Cody did not answer for more than 1 week i try to message him, e-mail him, nothing.... the week started and i got no plan, so i just repeated again the old month one with more 2.5 into each movement (this was the change between month 1 and 2) on Wednesday i got a email for him (it's a miracle its alive almost after 2 weeks...) he told me ""sorry, i was in my weeding anniversary please find attached the program"". First... This is utterly disrespectful, he almost did not apologize for lacking communication with me.... and Secondly the first week as not changed to 4days it was the same old 6days program again... Or the didn't read the email or he didn't care.  
So and i do believe Cody is a good guy i email him and explained how i felt, giving him a new opportunity, i needed form checks and i was not getting it. Cody apologized and ask me to record more angles and try to send more feedback, the form checks overall it was just pointing the problem and not explaining how to correct it. For example he says ""on your squat you tend to lean foward...""  
Also i asked him to incorporate more squats (as i was only hitting 6 singles of competitive squat) at first he read and did not care, when i asked again he put the squat on the plan. During this discussing i also told him for the Pendlay rows i think i was cheating a lot and told him as well. He agreed but no plan was changed, no weights were lowered, just put more 2.5 on the bar each week... I was already giving up and looking for other solutions as it did not matter if i did 3 reps or 30 reps...   


**Conclusion (TLDR):** 

* The coaching was a very bad experience;
* He sends over the same thing over and over again;
* He took a lot of time answering messages;
* He never had give proper attention to the requested topics;
* He never did a proper form check;
* He read the emails but did not pay any attention to them as everything that i suggested or that i told him was not feeling ok he ignored and send over again the same thing;
* He **ALWAYS** give excuses, or he lacked internet reception at the mountain, or it was on vacation, or the app did not work;
* He didn't adjust the weight accordingly to my performance the week before;
* Some videos that i send to him to youtube (and only him) are still with 0 views until today, but he answered regarding the videos that it was a good set :) 

&#x200B;

I can believe Cody have a great knowledge and coaching qualities but on my case, maybe we didn't ""click"", or i got him in a time he didn't have time or space for me, but as Coaching Result this was very bad, since in the end of the day i was making adjustments myself and look for youtube videos to try to correct form.

**2nd Month:**

So we jumped to the second month, he asked me if we could continue with the same schema and workout since he was seeing some improvements, of course i agree and basically i receive for the second month the same sheet (with minor tweaks only). Before anything that is **NOT INCORRECT** as in order to see improvements you cannot only dedicate 4 weeks into something and then switch. So it was ok and i agree, but Cody forgot again to remove the incline work and other stuff i explained that he don't have the equipment for, so i changed the sheet and explained him, he told me he forgot it (today i believe he don't even have cared but ok). So second month i was sending videos, got no answers outside good one, explode more. I even ask him if he didn't wanted any other angles video for more analysis has i may was lacking something and already giving the hint i was missing something from this Online Coaching. He answered yes you can record more angles... This was when i started to think something was not correct, so i was paying to somebody to help me i was doing his job, he should be the one asked my things so we can work together... But it could be a phase so i give another shot into month 3.

&#x200B;

**3rd Month:**

This was in Holidays season and i asked Cody since my gym closes for a lot of days the following. I would use this week opportunity to make a small deload and near the the end of the week try a PR that i wanted a lot (300kgs Deadlift, i missed near the lockout but 2020 gonna be the year i promise hehe), so i requested Cody this opportunity and to make sure this will not affect him i pay the upcoming month in the same day and told him no need to rush sending the training plan over the weekend, i only need it for the week after, send it when you can. 

Also since it was new year's eve and again the gym will be closed for a couple of days i requested the first week to only make a plan for 4 days (i train 6 normally). Cody did not answer for more than 1 week i try to message him, e-mail him, nothing.... the week started and i got no plan, so i just repeated again the old month one with more 2.5 into each movement (this was the change between month 1 and 2) on Wednesday i got a email for him (it's a miracle its alive almost after 2 weeks...) he told me ""sorry, i was in my weeding anniversary please find attached the program"". First... This is utterly disrespectful, he almost did not apologize for lacking communication with me.... and Secondly the first week as not changed to 4days it was the same old 6days program again... Or the didn't read the email or he didn't care.  
So and i do believe Cody is a good guy i email him and explained how i felt, giving him a new opportunity, i needed form checks and i was not getting it. Cody apologized and ask me to record more angles and try to send more feedback, the form checks overall it was just pointing the problem and not explaining how to correct it. For example he says ""on your squat you tend to lean foward...""  
Also i asked him to incorporate more squats (as i was only hitting 6 singles of competitive squat) at first he read and did not care, when i asked again he put the squat on the plan. During this discussing i also told him for the Pendlay rows i think i was cheating a lot and told him as well. He agreed but no plan was changed, no weights were lowered, just put more 2.5 on the bar each week... I was already giving up and looking for other solutions as it did not matter if i did 3 reps or 30 reps...   


**Conclusion (TLDR):** 

* The coaching was a very bad experience;
* He sends over the same thing over and over again;
* He took a lot of time answering messages;
* He never had give proper attention to the requested topics;
* He never did a proper form check;
* He read the emails but did not pay any attention to them as everything that i suggested or that i told him was not feeling ok he ignored and send over again the same thing;
* He **ALWAYS** give excuses, or he lacked internet reception at the mountain, or it was on vacation, or the app did not work;
* He didn't adjust the weight accordingly to my performance the week before;
* Some videos that i send to him to youtube (and only him) are still with 0 views until today, but he answered regarding the videos that it was a good set :) 

&#x200B;

I can believe Cody have a great knowledge and coaching qualities but on my case, maybe we didn't ""click"", or i got him in a time he didn't have time or space for me, but as Coaching Result this was very bad, since in the end of the day i was making adjustments myself and look for youtube videos to try to correct form.

Hopefully other feds take this kind of thing seriously as well.

Overall it was a very negative experience and I would not recommend his services to anyone.  

 His communication was poor, and when I brought this up he got annoyed and said he would only reply to ‘time sensitive queries’ and otherwise communication would be limited to weekly check in. This contradicts the ‘‘full coaching’ service he advertises, and during our facebook call prior to starting he mentioned that he takes his coaching very seriously as it is his full time job, and will respond within 24 hours. For someone that takes his coaching seriously he seems to think that treating clients well isn’t part of the job description.  


One week I sent two facebook message and an email in regards to knee pain and picking a meet, he completely ignored them. His excuse being that if he doesn’t respond it is because he missed the message, so to send him a reminder. I later did this in regards to updating my programming and he said ‘you have got to stop with the messages man’.  


Programming was good, mostly submaximal work which I expected, probably not appropriate for my novice level. Technique review was very detailed and he helped a lot with form, but this was only on weekly check-ins which he would send as late as Thursday evenings (I would send my check in Sunday morning.) So by the time I got my feedback, I had already finished half my week of training. I ended up stopping the service a week before the three months ended.  


It seems like from the Facebook group that a lot of his clients love him. So I am sure that some clients have had much better experiences than I had. However, this doesn’t justify the terrible service I paid for.  


His service is guided programming under the guise of ‘full coaching’. Perhaps if you are more of an advanced athlete you would have a truer ‘full coaching’ experience.

My current goal (after the Arnolds Sports Festival) is to go for the all time world record, which is currently [454 lbs @ 123 lbs bodyweight](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/records/raw/women-world). I would need to cut a tiny bit of weight since the USAPL and IPF have a 125 lb weight class and not 123. I would likely try and go for this record in a different federation so that I could use a deadlift bar (exactly like what Canditio's doing) and get some extra weight out of that.

The main reason I'm posting is I am curious about deadlift bars.
What are people's experience with deadlift bars in terms of how much they got out of it (particularly sumo pullers)? Also, does anyone know of a gym in the NOVA, DC area that has one so I would be able to feel it out before a competition?

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the sport of powerlifting with my first novice comp coming up in 5 weeks. I had recently signed up with Powerlifting Australia so I could compete in a Fed by the end of this year.

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the sport of powerlifting with my first novice comp coming up in 5 weeks. I had recently signed up with Powerlifting Australia so I could compete in a Fed by the end of this year.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to compete at the U.S. Open. I totaled 1576 (I think) while opting for knee sleeves at 165 pounds, going four-for-nine with best lifts of 529-396-650. Here is what happened:

I did a meet, back last December, also a USPA meet, in which I totaled 1670 (573-402-694) in the same class. That meet was initially done to make sure I qualified for the Open, but it became very important to me and I was dead-set on achieving my goal. I had what was the perfect meet; seven for eight, with a scratched final deadlift, after leaving no pounds whatsoever on the platform. I got everything possible out of all three lifts, which likely will never happen again.

Since that time, it was hard to be motivated to train, and compete. In my personal life, I received some pretty devastating news on Christmas day. Psychologically I am still not in a good place with it. Stress built up and I mailed in a lot of training. Yes, there were injuries. My quad is swollen and hurts pretty bad from my opener squat, and it has been a mess since the last meet. But those injuries didn't keep me from hitting a respectable total: the blame is between the ears.

Yes, I chose not to use wraps. Yes, I knew that would take me out of any running to win anything. I did it because I struggled--again, badly--in them, my squat was getting progressively worse, I could not hit depth and I hated every session. I opted for sleeves, trained in them for a week, squatted 525 for a triple and decided I would just open at 529.

The rest of the meet went fine. The cut went fine. I competed at a good bodyweight. Physically, I felt pretty strong. Mentally, I was checked completely out.

I made a commitment to do this meet and thought it was important to be there and honor that commitment, even though I was not ready. Getting humiliated by being clearly unprepared in front of a lot of people is a hard pill to swallow, but I am glad I showed up rather than stayed home.

As far as lifts:

Squat warm-ups felt great. I opened at 529 and missed it on depth. Took it again and made it, 2 to 1. I had no issues with this at my Dec. USPA meet, and it is a reflection of a real lack of proper preparation. Took 556 on my third and just missed it.

Bench also felt fine. Opened 380, got it. Went 396 to salvage something and got it, but it was a lot harder than I wanted it to be. At this point I didn’t care about 407/413 and scratched my third.

On deadlift, I opened at 650. With my openers, I just open at something I can triple, and I have tripled 650. That went fine. I went 677 and never in a million years expected to miss it. Well, I did. I threw in the towel after that. 

So, if you want a blueprint on how to lose 94 pounds on your total in four months, this is now a tried-and-true method.

What's next? I need to just get back to training, and to enjoying it. When I feel motivated again, I will choose a meet and compete. The fire is out right now. I have thought about hiring a coach for the first time in my life. I need someone to answer to, someone to do the thinking for me, and someone who will feel invested in my outcomes. Suggestions are appreciated. If you took the time to read this far, thank you.

uq6602,1652621405.0,Determine your relative strength using real competition data,"Hello all, I have made a website to help you compare your own lifts to actual competition data (sourced from the great openpowerlifting.com)

https://strengthcheck.me

Just select your gender/weight class (tested data uses IPF weight classes, all data uses untested weight classes), and you will see exactly where your lifts rate compared to everyone who has competed in your division.

I remember seeing this data tabulated a few years ago (https://www.strongerbyscience.com/how-to-get-strong-what-is-strong/) - this is just updated and interactive with a few more options.

I find this data interesting as will realise that everything you see on social media is really 99%+ percentile lifts, and that the average lifter really isn't so crazily strong. For instance, if you compete in the 83kg class, a 510kg total makes you stronger than half of the 22000 males who have competed in that class. Hopefully this will answer all the 'am i strong enough to compete' questions too.
 
Some details on the data

- Official competition data only

- Bench and deadlift includes single lift competitions, not just full power 

- Drug tested is using the openipf database

- All data uses the whole openpowerlifting database (tested and non tested)

- For non tested, there is a selector for wraps/sleeves, wrapped data includes only wrapped competitions only for squat and total data.

- Missing 4th attempts records at the moment (this is why Kevin oaks 390kg squat isn't the 100% percentile 110kg value)

- No age group filtering yet, but possibly later

- All the lb numbers are just translated from the kg equivalent, that's why they are all a bit random


Technical details

- vue frontend, all static (hosted in AWS s3/cloudfront)

- Uses a python script to turn the openpowerlifting data into percentile tables - this data json is then loaded in with the vue deployment.

- Currently the updating script/deployment is just run manually, but it won't really make any difference except for any latest records that have been set

mjy1vc,1617549122.0,Candito's 6 Weeks Program Review [Ran 3x],"Hey everyone, this is my first post on r/powerlifting, and I decided to share my thoughts and progress on [Candito's 6 Weeks Program](http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-programs/) and how I autoregulated this to see progress in my SBD. Before I go on, here's some background, so you know what kind of lifter I am.

I'm a 171cm/5'7"", 73KG/160lbs, 23M Singaporean aspiring competitive powerlifter (so I haven't competed yet, but planning soon when the federations here are allowed to hold a meet!) and previously, I lifted for about two years doing a mix of fuck-all and bodybuilding. Before making a switch to training solely for powerlifting, I consistently used [nSuns's 5/3/1](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/) and saw very little progress as my body couldn't recover very well from all the volume work. As a full-time designer, while also doing full-time studies, I needed a program designed with periodisation such that I can recover in a way my body is more suited to.

Throughout my previous gym experience, I suffered from a left rotator cuff injury from overhead pressing. Really unnecessary injury, but I had to live with it as a lesson for myself.

I ran Candito's 6 Week Program for three full cycles, but some autoregulation and adjustments extended the program by a week or more. You can't really consider them exactly ""6 weeks"". I started my program in mid-November 2020 and consistently ran the program till March 2021 (so it's about 20 weeks).

Some caveats:

* My PRs are gym PRs;
* I tested all my lifts on separate days, not using an SBD day;
* I always tested my PR, even though the program doesn't necessarily require you to
* I bench pressed and low-bar squatted with wrist wraps
* I didn't use a belt for all my PRs (I'm too broke for it, LOL)
* \#SumoIsLife
* I hook grip, so rip thumbs
* My leverages aren't the best, but not the worst. I have average length arms, average length femurs.

&#x200B;

||*Week 0 (Mid-Nov, 2020)*|*1st Cycle (Dec, 2020)*|*2nd Cycle (Mid-Jan, 2020)*|*3rd Cycle (Mar, 2020)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Squat*|100kg (220lbs)|110kg (243lbs)|130kg (286lbs)|140kg (308lbs)|
|*Bench*|95kg (209lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (220lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (231lbs) comp-style|110kg (243lbs) comp-style|
|*Deadlift*|140kg (308lbs)|150kg (330lbs)|180kg (396lbs)|200kg (441lbs)|
|Total|335kg (738lbs)|360kg (794lbs)|410kg (904lbs)|450kg (992lbs)|

In short, after 20 weeks, my total went from 335kg/738lbs to 450kg/992lbs.

Almost a thousand-pound total and in between, I even managed to fix my deadlift and low-bar squat form, which probably contributed to the jump you see from 1st cycle to 2nd cycle.

Generally, this is what I applied to make Candito's awfully good for my progress.

# Understanding my Body's Reaction

I started my 1st cycle without adjusting anything. Suppose Candito told me to do 3x8 for a barbell row, sure. If there wasn't an accessory exercise for the day, I didn't any. Overall, I found some personal issues with the program that I can tweak:

1. Bench volume was too low
2. Squat volume was too high
3. Deadlifting after squatting didn't feel too bad, but I felt better doing the reverse

**Note: the program tells you to use your Week 5 lift results to calculate your max. I disregard it and treat it as a max peaking phase and add back-off sets to accessorise. I test my lifts on Week 6.**

Here's what I did to adjust to the program specifically for each of the three lifts:

# Bench Press

This program gets a common complaint about having too little volume for bench press, and that's right. If you follow the program to a tee, you'll find that you're doing more back and shoulder work right after bench press, without having insofar a single compound accessory that's a push and *not* shoulder work.

Hence, I always added more sets and tweaked the weights and intensity according to the week's goal (e.g. if I'm starting to peak, I'll dial back the reps and up the weight).

Here's a general recommendation:

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Larsen Press (70%, 3x5)|Closed-Grip (60%, 3x8)|
|2|Larsen Press (80%, 4x4)|Closed-Grip (70%, 3x5)|
|3|Paused Bench (85%, 3x3)|Larsen Press (80%, 3x2)|
|4|Paused Bench (90%, 3x2)||
|5|Paused Bench (95 - 97.5%, 3x1)||

Why?

* Larsen + Closed-Grip is a killer back-off exercise after bench, but really good for volume work.
* Paused Bench can vary from 1s to 3s paused, but the idea is to get really good with the technique and mimic competition style with a weight that I can reliably perform anytime.

I also threw in much back work and shoulder work rather than working on chest stuff with the dumbbell. This was a philosophy transferred from nSuns; if **I am to bench** ***n*** **kg, I should also be rowing** ***n*** **kg** for at least one rep with good form.

# Squat

Squat was an unfortunate lift. I had a ""stripper squat"":

* Knees tracked too far
* Torso fell forward a lot
* Hip shift to the right
* Using my quads to drive rather than from the bottom-up

Overall, shit form. My squats were so goddamn ugly. I fixed that in Week 1 and got my groove by learning to lift without the mirror. Since I constantly used the mirror to watch my squat, I kept using it to judge depth, judge barbell position and became overly reliant on visuals rather than my body.

My squat is still somewhat ugly, but I was squatting with much less injury potential. Side note, I still hate squats!

Here is my general recommendation on what I did for my accessory:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Squats (60%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (60%, 3x3)|
|2|Squats (70%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (70%, 3x3)|
|3|Paused Squats (80%, 3x2)||
|4|Paused Squats (90%, 2x2)||
|5|Paused Squats (95%, 2x1)||

I didn't include front squats because my quads were *wayyyyy* more developed than my hammies and glutes. I also included other accessories after squats:

* The best way to improve squat is to do more squats (with good form throughout, of course)
* Paused squats help me build more confidence in performing sub max lifts reliably.

Because I did deadlifts before squats, my posterior chain is totally fried, and I usually end the day by the end.

# Deadlift

Yes, I do sumo deadlift, and I absolutely love it. You can see why there's a 60kg gap between my deadlift and squat (more on that later). I tweaked my form throughout the cycle after realising that it was a [knee hinge](https://www.elitefts.com/education/the-sumo-deadlift-youre-doing-it-the-wrong-way/). More tweaking later, and I worked out a form that's more suited to my body.

Here are the accessories that I did from Cycle 1 to 3:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Conventional Deadlift (65-70%, 3x5)||
|2|Conventional Deadlift (75-80%, 4x3)|Paused Sumo (70%, 2x4)|
|3|Paused Sumo (80%, 3x3)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|4|Paused Sumo (85-90%, 3x2)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|5|Paused Sumo (90%, 2x2)|Deficit Paused (75%, 3x3)|

Why?

* Conventional helps with the hip hinge at lockout (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong), but since I don't lift conventional I treat it as volume work;
* Paused sumo really helps a lot, much like how I programmed paused squats and paused bench. It's really to build confidence with the weight, but paused sumo also drove me to get good with my form.
* Deficit paused is a real killer, but it helps with squeezing out every bit of my legs.

# Reflections from 3 cycles:

Gonna keep this short so in sum:

* For every set of bench, I tried to do 2 sets of back work. If there were 9 sets of bench, I did 18 sets of back work (varying exercises)
* Row your bench weight
* Am I a deadlift specialist? Probably not, I suck at squats, and I'm unconfident about it. Going under the bar and feeling the whip makes me feel dread. Mental strength is critical.
* Take care of your rotator cuffs
* Rear delts are your best friend
* Warm-up like hell and activate every muscle you need for the lift that day.
   * Bench: hip flexors, glutes, upper back, lower back, delts, and triceps.
   * Squat: hip flexors, glutes, back, chest stretches (for low-bar), more lat specific stretches, quads, hamstrings
   * Deadlift: ~~every damn thing~~ hip flexors, glutes, lats, upper back, quads and hamstrings

# What I'm going to do from now on:

I will run the program three more times again as I've already seen progress during my training. Previous RPE8s now feel like RPE7s, and my hook grip is getting better. This time, I'll do things a bit differently after I end this cycle:

1. More shoulder work. My overhead press is still a paltry 55kg/121lbs for a 1RM, and I believe there is a substantial carryover.
2. I will up the bench volume so that I can work on my leg drive. Most of my PRs for the bench are still quite reliant on my chest and shoulder strength, not so much for my leg drive
3. Squat more!

Thanks for reading this long-ass review! I'll be back 20 weeks later to share my progress.

*Just to share my targets by the end of three cycles so I can look back at this post and see if I've done it:*

* Squat: 170kg/396lbs
* Bench: 120kg/264lbs

Not sure if this is allowed (mods please feel free to remove this), but I post my lifts on my Instagram account ([@onlygoodatsumo](https://www.instagram.com/onlygoodatsumo/)). We'll see if I surpass my goals!",powerlifting,"Candito's 6 Weeks Program Review [Ran 3x] Hey everyone, this is my first post on r/powerlifting, and I decided to share my thoughts and progress on [Candito's 6 Weeks Program](http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-programs/) and how I autoregulated this to see progress in my SBD. Before I go on, here's some background, so you know what kind of lifter I am.

I'm a 171cm/5'7"", 73KG/160lbs, 23M Singaporean aspiring competitive powerlifter (so I haven't competed yet, but planning soon when the federations here are allowed to hold a meet!) and previously, I lifted for about two years doing a mix of fuck-all and bodybuilding. Before making a switch to training solely for powerlifting, I consistently used [nSuns's 5/3/1](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/) and saw very little progress as my body couldn't recover very well from all the volume work. As a full-time designer, while also doing full-time studies, I needed a program designed with periodisation such that I can recover in a way my body is more suited to.

Throughout my previous gym experience, I suffered from a left rotator cuff injury from overhead pressing. Really unnecessary injury, but I had to live with it as a lesson for myself.

I ran Candito's 6 Week Program for three full cycles, but some autoregulation and adjustments extended the program by a week or more. You can't really consider them exactly ""6 weeks"". I started my program in mid-November 2020 and consistently ran the program till March 2021 (so it's about 20 weeks).

Some caveats:

* My PRs are gym PRs;
* I tested all my lifts on separate days, not using an SBD day;
* I always tested my PR, even though the program doesn't necessarily require you to
* I bench pressed and low-bar squatted with wrist wraps
* I didn't use a belt for all my PRs (I'm too broke for it, LOL)
* \#SumoIsLife
* I hook grip, so rip thumbs
* My leverages aren't the best, but not the worst. I have average length arms, average length femurs.

&#x200B;

||*Week 0 (Mid-Nov, 2020)*|*1st Cycle (Dec, 2020)*|*2nd Cycle (Mid-Jan, 2020)*|*3rd Cycle (Mar, 2020)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Squat*|100kg (220lbs)|110kg (243lbs)|130kg (286lbs)|140kg (308lbs)|
|*Bench*|95kg (209lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (220lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (231lbs) comp-style|110kg (243lbs) comp-style|

|Total|335kg (738lbs)|360kg (794lbs)|410kg (904lbs)|450kg (992lbs)|

In short, after 20 weeks, my total went from 335kg/738lbs to 450kg/992lbs.

Almost a thousand-pound total and in between, I even managed to fix my deadlift and low-bar squat form, which probably contributed to the jump you see from 1st cycle to 2nd cycle.

Generally, this is what I applied to make Candito's awfully good for my progress.

# Understanding my Body's Reaction

I started my 1st cycle without adjusting anything. Suppose Candito told me to do 3x8 for a barbell row, sure. If there wasn't an accessory exercise for the day, I didn't any. Overall, I found some personal issues with the program that I can tweak:

1. Bench volume was too low
2. Squat volume was too high
3. Deadlifting after squatting didn't feel too bad, but I felt better doing the reverse

**Note: the program tells you to use your Week 5 lift results to calculate your max. I disregard it and treat it as a max peaking phase and add back-off sets to accessorise. I test my lifts on Week 6.**

Here's what I did to adjust to the program specifically for each of the three lifts:

# Bench Press

This program gets a common complaint about having too little volume for bench press, and that's right. If you follow the program to a tee, you'll find that you're doing more back and shoulder work right after bench press, without having insofar a single compound accessory that's a push and *not* shoulder work.

Hence, I always added more sets and tweaked the weights and intensity according to the week's goal (e.g. if I'm starting to peak, I'll dial back the reps and up the weight).

Here's a general recommendation:

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Larsen Press (70%, 3x5)|Closed-Grip (60%, 3x8)|
|2|Larsen Press (80%, 4x4)|Closed-Grip (70%, 3x5)|
|3|Paused Bench (85%, 3x3)|Larsen Press (80%, 3x2)|
|4|Paused Bench (90%, 3x2)||
|5|Paused Bench (95 - 97.5%, 3x1)||

Why?

* Larsen + Closed-Grip is a killer back-off exercise after bench, but really good for volume work.
* Paused Bench can vary from 1s to 3s paused, but the idea is to get really good with the technique and mimic competition style with a weight that I can reliably perform anytime.

I also threw in much back work and shoulder work rather than working on chest stuff with the dumbbell. This was a philosophy transferred from nSuns; if **I am to bench** ***n*** **kg, I should also be rowing** ***n*** **kg** for at least one rep with good form.

# Squat

Squat was an unfortunate lift. I had a ""stripper squat"":

* Knees tracked too far
* Torso fell forward a lot
* Hip shift to the right
* Using my quads to drive rather than from the bottom-up

Overall, shit form. My squats were so goddamn ugly. I fixed that in Week 1 and got my groove by learning to lift without the mirror. Since I constantly used the mirror to watch my squat, I kept using it to judge depth, judge barbell position and became overly reliant on visuals rather than my body.

My squat is still somewhat ugly, but I was squatting with much less injury potential. Side note, I still hate squats!

Here is my general recommendation on what I did for my accessory:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Squats (60%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (60%, 3x3)|
|2|Squats (70%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (70%, 3x3)|
|3|Paused Squats (80%, 3x2)||
|4|Paused Squats (90%, 2x2)||
|5|Paused Squats (95%, 2x1)||

I didn't include front squats because my quads were *wayyyyy* more developed than my hammies and glutes. I also included other accessories after squats:

* The best way to improve squat is to do more squats (with good form throughout, of course)
* Paused squats help me build more confidence in performing sub max lifts reliably.

Because I did deadlifts before squats, my posterior chain is totally fried, and I usually end the day by the end.

# Deadlift

Yes, I do sumo deadlift, and I absolutely love it. You can see why there's a 60kg gap between my deadlift and squat (more on that later). I tweaked my form throughout the cycle after realising that it was a [knee hinge](https://www.elitefts.com/education/the-sumo-deadlift-youre-doing-it-the-wrong-way/). More tweaking later, and I worked out a form that's more suited to my body.

Here are the accessories that I did from Cycle 1 to 3:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Conventional Deadlift (65-70%, 3x5)||
|2|Conventional Deadlift (75-80%, 4x3)|Paused Sumo (70%, 2x4)|
|3|Paused Sumo (80%, 3x3)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|4|Paused Sumo (85-90%, 3x2)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|5|Paused Sumo (90%, 2x2)|Deficit Paused (75%, 3x3)|

Why?

* Conventional helps with the hip hinge at lockout (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong), but since I don't lift conventional I treat it as volume work;
* Paused sumo really helps a lot, much like how I programmed paused squats and paused bench. It's really to build confidence with the weight, but paused sumo also drove me to get good with my form.
* Deficit paused is a real killer, but it helps with squeezing out every bit of my legs.

# Reflections from 3 cycles:

Gonna keep this short so in sum:

* For every set of bench, I tried to do 2 sets of back work. If there were 9 sets of bench, I did 18 sets of back work (varying exercises)
* Row your bench weight
* Am I a deadlift specialist? Probably not, I suck at squats, and I'm unconfident about it. Going under the bar and feeling the whip makes me feel dread. Mental strength is critical.
* Take care of your rotator cuffs
* Rear delts are your best friend
* Warm-up like hell and activate every muscle you need for the lift that day.
   * Bench: hip flexors, glutes, upper back, lower back, delts, and triceps.
   * Squat: hip flexors, glutes, back, chest stretches (for low-bar), more lat specific stretches, quads, hamstrings
   * Deadlift: ~~every damn thing~~ hip flexors, glutes, lats, upper back, quads and hamstrings

# What I'm going to do from now on:

I will run the program three more times again as I've already seen progress during my training. Previous RPE8s now feel like RPE7s, and my hook grip is getting better. This time, I'll do things a bit differently after I end this cycle:

1. More shoulder work. My overhead press is still a paltry 55kg/121lbs for a 1RM, and I believe there is a substantial carryover.
2. I will up the bench volume so that I can work on my leg drive. Most of my PRs for the bench are still quite reliant on my chest and shoulder strength, not so much for my leg drive
3. Squat more!

Thanks for reading this long-ass review! I'll be back 20 weeks later to share my progress.

*Just to share my targets by the end of three cycles so I can look back at this post and see if I've done it:*

* Squat: 170kg/396lbs
* Bench: 120kg/264lbs
* Deadlift: 240kg/507lbs
* Total: 530kg/1168lbs

02/24/24 - I had an amazing time at my first meet! I competed in the USPA Open Raw Full Power 82.5kg class(wanted to get into the 75kg class but my little brother really wanted to compete and I wanted our first meets to be together) I started lifting at the gym again 6 months ago after not working out for 5 years.. i reached 248 lbs at 5’4 and weighed into this meet at 175 which I am stoked on.. I am not the strongest but I am so happy with my progress and I plan to keep going!! I went 9/9 which was amazing to me and I also hit PRs on my 3rd attempts on bench and deadlifts which made me feel accomplished.. the environment was amazing, everyone rooting for everyone! If you ever are contemplating on competing, just do it! Your numbers you put up currently shouldn’t stop you! It didn’t stop me! Thanks for reading ! 🫶🏻

jxs2h0,1605889339.0,[BOOK REVIEW] LOUIE SIMMONS' IRON SAMURAI,"Full disclosure: I was, am, and will always be a Westside Barbell fanboy.  I started lifting in 1999, and when I started “researching” on the internet, the ONLY way to train for strength was to “do Westside Barbell”, so that’s what I grew up with and it will always hold a special place in my heart.  Because of that, when I saw that Louie Simmons had released a 306 page book detailing his life and the story of Westside Barbell AND that it was on sale, I legit just pulled out a credit card and paid whatever it cost to have.  Along with that, having followed Louie for so long, I’m VERY familiar with his particular brand of insanity as it relates to writing and speaking, so I was able to look past a lot of things in this book that will most likely be completely unbearable to a new reader.


All that said, let me start with the conclusion: if you’re NOT a fan of Westside barbell, I’d skip this book.  This is pure fan service: going into drama, behind the scenes stuff, crazy stories, stats, facts and figures.  Hardcore powerlifting fans, and specifically those of Westside, will get a kick out of it, but those that are just fans of lifting in general hoping to “learn from the master” aren’t going to get much for the price point.  There is SOME gold in this regarding training for powerlifting, but you gotta mine the hell out of the book to find it.


That said, I read the whole thing in 3 days of casual reading.  It’s an easy read and I found it pretty enjoyable.  Because Louie is so scatterbrained, it actually makes the book well paced, because Louie will start on a boring subject but out of nowhere tell a story about a guy kidnapping a dog and getting 100 days in jail before switching back to talking about band tension calculations.  It keeps you on your toes.


Below are the notes I took as I read the book, to give you an idea of what I was thinking/feeling at the time.  Enjoy!

---

* Written all on the third person: Louie’s alter ego talking about Louie.

* Written in Louie’s delightfully insane “steam of consciousness” writing/speaking style.  If you’re unfamiliar with it, it will be jarring.  If you’re familiar with it, it will still be jarring, but you’ll be used to it.

* Holy hell, Louie does a subtle callout of Ironmind early in the writing: accuses them of stealing the idea of the “magic circle” and Super Squats.   As a rabid Ironmind AND Westside Fanboy, I’m vexed.

* In general, Louie doesn’t go easy on anyone in the book.  He’ll praise people for strengths and speak matter* of* factly about their weaknesses (so and so was a bad squatter, so and so never did well in the sport and went on to become a ref, etc etc).  When I went to Kaz’s seminar, it was very similar.  Don’t know if this is a generational thing, a “being one of the greatest of all time” thing, a “I’m too damn old to worry about being nice” thing, or just a thing, but it’s honestly pretty cool to have no doubt about the thoughts of the author.

* Louie’s “The Ball or the Sword” story gives the reader a solid understanding of why he is the way he is.  The quote “Louie believes that if a powerlifter doesn’t want to invest his or her life into powerlifting, he or she shouldn’t waste their time” is why he uses the methods he uses.  It’s also why he’s so into unlimited ply, and only cares about the biggest numbers period dot: because THAT is powerlifting.  It’s not about who is the best with an asterisk (raw, under 40, 2 hour weigh in, drug tested, etc etc), but simply who can put up the most.

* Louie’s age shows primarily in the things he thinks are acceptable to write.  If you are sensitive to social issues, it’s most likely not going to go over well for you.  I’m 73 pages in, and have encountered one homophobic slur (not said by Louie, but relayed by him as something one lifter said to another) and his advocacy of “Lucha Underground where men beat the hell out of the hot women; it’s twice the fun.” I’m old enough that I “get” his generation, and after reading Dick Marcinko’s “Rogue Warrior” I doubt anything an author writes can be offensive to me at this point, but it may be jarring to other readers.

* “but Louie, in 1982, would not read any scientific studies from an American author.” Man can I dig that.  Paul Kelso was speaking illy of the state of exercise science in the 80s in “Powerlifitng Basics Texas Style” as well.  

* “Louie first found the importance of the Dynamic Method. Most lifters divided training days from heavy to light. But strength is measured in velocities, not heavy or light. Instead, it is measured by fast, intermediate, or slow.” I feel real stupid for having not thought of it like that before.  And part of that is most likely because I’m not a speedy lifter to begin with.  

* Louie is unapologetic in how much he despises how US Weightlifters are being trained these days.  The topic comes up a LOT in the book.  I imagine it’s a result of him coming from a weightlifting background: we never forget our first love.  I am so vocally against powerlifting these days, and it’s because that’s where I started and it’s rough for me to see the state it’s in right now.  Of course, I’ve also said that we do so poorly in weightlifting that we may as well give Louie the reigns and see what happens, but I am a fan of chaos.

* Louie misspells the names of a lot of lifters in the book.  Just ran across “Glen Pendley”, and I know I’ve seen more throughout the book.

* “but that the real key was the special single* joint exercises.” People don’t get this about Westside.  They think it’s just DE and ME, but that’s only 20% of the training.  EIGHTY PERCENT is Repetition Effort.  THAT is where the magic happens.

* “Producing the rule book and training qualified referees were the key focus of the IPF. Louie did not agree that an IPF qualified referee status could be achieved in two months of studying a rule book when it took three to five years to be an Elite level lifter” Love it

* “To this day, Louie believes that if an athlete is subject to being tested, then everyone connected to the federation should be checked, including refs, spotters, officials, meet directors, and the guy who collects the door money.” Also love it.

* “Also, the IPF had drug testing, and lots of people were opposed to having their civil rights invaded” as a political science guy, this stuff always bugs me.  Your civil rights cannot be violated by a private organization: only the government can violate your rights.
  
* There’s a whole section on federation drama, if you’re into that.  Oh powerlifting.

* “It is hard for Louie to understand why powerlifters bad mouth each other instead of uniting together” ok, that is a comical lack of self* awareness given how the book has gone so far.

* Nice to see Louie write positively on Chuck V.  Their relationship was strained for a while, but seems to be in a good place.  And really, anything written about Chuck is awesome.  He’s a goddamn sasquatch in all ways, because along with being huge and scary, there’s SO little out there about him, because he doesn’t talk.

* I’m at a part in the book where Louie talks about a buddy of his throwing his food on the floor at a restaurant and assaulting the cooks because they put onions in his food.  This is one of many stories of downright psychopathy.  I can’t tell if Louie attracts these kinds of people, or if there are just more of these folks out there than I realize.

* Tons of stories start with “so and so knew a 13/14/15 year old kid that was really strong and he started lifting at Westside and etc etc”.  I find it a little off putting how so many of these adult men are just hanging out with these teenage boys.  And maybe it just shows how uninvolved I am with my local community, but it just feels weird reading it so much.

* “Ryan Cannelie” for Ryan Kennelly.  Ok, this book was clearly never edited or proofread. 

* I feel like someone may have tried to help Louie at the start of the book and then eventually gave up, because around page 135 or so Louie’s rambling style of writing really starts to take off.  Again: if you’re familiar with it, it’s not bad, but if this is your first exposure to how Louie presents ideas, you’re in for a ride.

* All criticism aside (so far), I’m 165 pages in and all I can think is “This is what ‘Westside vs the World’ SHOULD have been”

* “a bodybuilder is at his or her weakest and smallest at contest time. In contrast, however, a powerlifter is at his or her strongest and biggest at contest time.” That’s honestly a pretty interesting revelation.  Something to be said about the razor’s edge of health/performance a powerlifter is on for a meet peak though.  

* “Sue came to Westside overweight. She wanted to powerlift to get into shape. Most of the time, this does not work” I hope people are taking goddamn notes here!  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a 300+lber start lifting to “get in shape” and then put on a bunch more bodyweight because they’re “naturally talented” at heavy lifting.  No dude: you have mass, and mass moves mass.  You started exercising to get healthy: get healthy, THEN put on mass.

* “Also, normal people can only give you normal results.”* DING DING DING.  People are in such a rush to normalize things, but that’s the whole point: you gotta be and do things differently to achieve different results.

* “He thought it would take a weight gain to do it, so Louie pushed up the volume and added more calories.”* Straight from the master’s mouth folks.  Quit trying to bulk on Starting Strength: up the volume, up the calories.

* The “Nightrider” section is brutal.  Just a long list of callouts by Louie on former Westsiders.

* Don’t skim the book, because Louie’s crazy mind throws things in at random spots.  The section on Chuck V under world record squatters suddenly turns into a seminar on how bands work.

* Louie throws some shade at EliteFTS, clarifying that they are separate businesses.  It’s gotta be tough to be Louie’s friend I am sure.

* Louie writes that he will never watch “Westside vs the World”.  Good call Louie.

* It was heartwarming to see how positively Louie speaks of Jim Wendler.  

* Page 214 and now the homophobic slur IS coming directly from Louie.  It’s a quote from the 90s, and I get times were different, but still, it just takes a book that reads like a kindly old man retelling stories from the past and puts a lot of ugliness in it in short order.

* Louie refers to Dave Hoff as the strongest geared lifter of all time, which is honestly a shock for Louie.  I’m used to him not differentiating between gear and raw, just referring to lifters as lifters.  Wonder if he’s finally gotten sick enough of the politics to feel the need to clarify at this point.

* Some of these stories about Westside personalities are just painful to get through.   Helpful reminder that being a good lifter doesn’t mean being a good person.  Often, it can even be necessary to not be one to be the other.  This is a selfish hobby.

* I remember in 07 when I wanted to “Do Westside Barbell training” and the common question was “can I still do it if I don’t have a GHR/reverse hyper”, and guys like Tate and Wendler would say you don’t need that stuff and would offer up old school movements like GHRs and RDLs and back extensions.  But when you read this book, you realize just how important all the crazy crap Louie developed is for the success of Westside.  And yeah, Westside may have STARTED with just the basics, but it’s clearly evolved, and the idea that you can follow the program without all the specialty equipment is really getting silly now.  20% of the training is ME/DE, and the rest is all super specialized bodybuilder work.

* “For some odd reason, lots of Louie’s friends go to jail” at least Louie is aware this is weird.

* “The Curse” is an awesome section of the book that describes why Louie will set out to help anyone in the world of lifting.  Very touching.

* So far the last half of the book is basically Louie listing names of people and lifts that they did/how those lifts improved while training at Westside.  This is pretty typical Louie Simmons stuff.  His articles are all like this too.  What’s crazy is Louie will screw up the spelling of the name of someone he’s known for 25 years but will know down to the POUND how much that person squatted at a meet in 1996.

* Louie advises a rubgy coach to have his players wrestle in the off* season to cut down in season injuries.  Goddamn do I love that suggestion/solution.  

* I’m on page 273 of 306 and the book is just running completely off the rails.  Any semblance of organization is gone, and it’s just Louie finding jumping off points to rant about people and things.  Which isn’t to say that it’s not entertaining, but again, for those that prefer structure: you won’t find it here.

* Ok, now the homophobic slur isn’t a quote from the 90s or a quote from someone else.  Come on Louie.

* There’s a story about a lifter not knowing what order a powerlifting meet runs in (as far as order of lifts) and then going on to set a pro total.  There’s a lesson there about how being super academic about your sport probably doesn’t matter as much as simply being strong.

* So many of Louie’s stories about lifters end with “they died much too young”.  Probably something to take away from that.

* Last 10 pages of the book are an excellent example of the need for competition in powerlifting in order to get stronger.  It can’t just be going against a spreadsheet.  Competing against a real human drives us to get stronger.  Also, at the very end, it says Louie banned all the members of the night crew of Westside for life, which included Dave Hoff.  Man, I can’t keep up with the drama.",powerlifting,"[BOOK REVIEW] LOUIE SIMMONS' IRON SAMURAI Full disclosure: I was, am, and will always be a Westside Barbell fanboy.  I started lifting in 1999, and when I started “researching” on the internet, the ONLY way to train for strength was to “do Westside Barbell”, so that’s what I grew up with and it will always hold a special place in my heart.  Because of that, when I saw that Louie Simmons had released a 306 page book detailing his life and the story of Westside Barbell AND that it was on sale, I legit just pulled out a credit card and paid whatever it cost to have.  Along with that, having followed Louie for so long, I’m VERY familiar with his particular brand of insanity as it relates to writing and speaking, so I was able to look past a lot of things in this book that will most likely be completely unbearable to a new reader.


All that said, let me start with the conclusion: if you’re NOT a fan of Westside barbell, I’d skip this book.  This is pure fan service: going into drama, behind the scenes stuff, crazy stories, stats, facts and figures.  Hardcore powerlifting fans, and specifically those of Westside, will get a kick out of it, but those that are just fans of lifting in general hoping to “learn from the master” aren’t going to get much for the price point.  There is SOME gold in this regarding training for powerlifting, but you gotta mine the hell out of the book to find it.


That said, I read the whole thing in 3 days of casual reading.  It’s an easy read and I found it pretty enjoyable.  Because Louie is so scatterbrained, it actually makes the book well paced, because Louie will start on a boring subject but out of nowhere tell a story about a guy kidnapping a dog and getting 100 days in jail before switching back to talking about band tension calculations.  It keeps you on your toes.


Below are the notes I took as I read the book, to give you an idea of what I was thinking/feeling at the time.  Enjoy!

---

* Written all on the third person: Louie’s alter ego talking about Louie.

* Written in Louie’s delightfully insane “steam of consciousness” writing/speaking style.  If you’re unfamiliar with it, it will be jarring.  If you’re familiar with it, it will still be jarring, but you’ll be used to it.

* Holy hell, Louie does a subtle callout of Ironmind early in the writing: accuses them of stealing the idea of the “magic circle” and Super Squats.   As a rabid Ironmind AND Westside Fanboy, I’m vexed.

* In general, Louie doesn’t go easy on anyone in the book.  He’ll praise people for strengths and speak matter* of* factly about their weaknesses (so and so was a bad squatter, so and so never did well in the sport and went on to become a ref, etc etc).  When I went to Kaz’s seminar, it was very similar.  Don’t know if this is a generational thing, a “being one of the greatest of all time” thing, a “I’m too damn old to worry about being nice” thing, or just a thing, but it’s honestly pretty cool to have no doubt about the thoughts of the author.

* Louie’s “The Ball or the Sword” story gives the reader a solid understanding of why he is the way he is.  The quote “Louie believes that if a powerlifter doesn’t want to invest his or her life into powerlifting, he or she shouldn’t waste their time” is why he uses the methods he uses.  It’s also why he’s so into unlimited ply, and only cares about the biggest numbers period dot: because THAT is powerlifting.  It’s not about who is the best with an asterisk (raw, under 40, 2 hour weigh in, drug tested, etc etc), but simply who can put up the most.

* Louie’s age shows primarily in the things he thinks are acceptable to write.  If you are sensitive to social issues, it’s most likely not going to go over well for you.  I’m 73 pages in, and have encountered one homophobic slur (not said by Louie, but relayed by him as something one lifter said to another) and his advocacy of “Lucha Underground where men beat the hell out of the hot women; it’s twice the fun.” I’m old enough that I “get” his generation, and after reading Dick Marcinko’s “Rogue Warrior” I doubt anything an author writes can be offensive to me at this point, but it may be jarring to other readers.

* “but Louie, in 1982, would not read any scientific studies from an American author.” Man can I dig that.  Paul Kelso was speaking illy of the state of exercise science in the 80s in “Powerlifitng Basics Texas Style” as well.  

* “Louie first found the importance of the Dynamic Method. Most lifters divided training days from heavy to light. But strength is measured in velocities, not heavy or light. Instead, it is measured by fast, intermediate, or slow.” I feel real stupid for having not thought of it like that before.  And part of that is most likely because I’m not a speedy lifter to begin with.  

* Louie is unapologetic in how much he despises how US Weightlifters are being trained these days.  The topic comes up a LOT in the book.  I imagine it’s a result of him coming from a weightlifting background: we never forget our first love.  I am so vocally against powerlifting these days, and it’s because that’s where I started and it’s rough for me to see the state it’s in right now.  Of course, I’ve also said that we do so poorly in weightlifting that we may as well give Louie the reigns and see what happens, but I am a fan of chaos.

* Louie misspells the names of a lot of lifters in the book.  Just ran across “Glen Pendley”, and I know I’ve seen more throughout the book.

* “but that the real key was the special single* joint exercises.” People don’t get this about Westside.  They think it’s just DE and ME, but that’s only 20% of the training.  EIGHTY PERCENT is Repetition Effort.  THAT is where the magic happens.

* “Producing the rule book and training qualified referees were the key focus of the IPF. Louie did not agree that an IPF qualified referee status could be achieved in two months of studying a rule book when it took three to five years to be an Elite level lifter” Love it

* “To this day, Louie believes that if an athlete is subject to being tested, then everyone connected to the federation should be checked, including refs, spotters, officials, meet directors, and the guy who collects the door money.” Also love it.

* “Also, the IPF had drug testing, and lots of people were opposed to having their civil rights invaded” as a political science guy, this stuff always bugs me.  Your civil rights cannot be violated by a private organization: only the government can violate your rights.
  
* There’s a whole section on federation drama, if you’re into that.  Oh powerlifting.

* “It is hard for Louie to understand why powerlifters bad mouth each other instead of uniting together” ok, that is a comical lack of self* awareness given how the book has gone so far.

* Nice to see Louie write positively on Chuck V.  Their relationship was strained for a while, but seems to be in a good place.  And really, anything written about Chuck is awesome.  He’s a goddamn sasquatch in all ways, because along with being huge and scary, there’s SO little out there about him, because he doesn’t talk.

* I’m at a part in the book where Louie talks about a buddy of his throwing his food on the floor at a restaurant and assaulting the cooks because they put onions in his food.  This is one of many stories of downright psychopathy.  I can’t tell if Louie attracts these kinds of people, or if there are just more of these folks out there than I realize.

* Tons of stories start with “so and so knew a 13/14/15 year old kid that was really strong and he started lifting at Westside and etc etc”.  I find it a little off putting how so many of these adult men are just hanging out with these teenage boys.  And maybe it just shows how uninvolved I am with my local community, but it just feels weird reading it so much.

* “Ryan Cannelie” for Ryan Kennelly.  Ok, this book was clearly never edited or proofread. 

* I feel like someone may have tried to help Louie at the start of the book and then eventually gave up, because around page 135 or so Louie’s rambling style of writing really starts to take off.  Again: if you’re familiar with it, it’s not bad, but if this is your first exposure to how Louie presents ideas, you’re in for a ride.

* All criticism aside (so far), I’m 165 pages in and all I can think is “This is what ‘Westside vs the World’ SHOULD have been”

* “a bodybuilder is at his or her weakest and smallest at contest time. In contrast, however, a powerlifter is at his or her strongest and biggest at contest time.” That’s honestly a pretty interesting revelation.  Something to be said about the razor’s edge of health/performance a powerlifter is on for a meet peak though.  

* “Sue came to Westside overweight. She wanted to powerlift to get into shape. Most of the time, this does not work” I hope people are taking goddamn notes here!  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a 300+lber start lifting to “get in shape” and then put on a bunch more bodyweight because they’re “naturally talented” at heavy lifting.  No dude: you have mass, and mass moves mass.  You started exercising to get healthy: get healthy, THEN put on mass.

* “Also, normal people can only give you normal results.”* DING DING DING.  People are in such a rush to normalize things, but that’s the whole point: you gotta be and do things differently to achieve different results.

* “He thought it would take a weight gain to do it, so Louie pushed up the volume and added more calories.”* Straight from the master’s mouth folks.  Quit trying to bulk on Starting Strength: up the volume, up the calories.

* The “Nightrider” section is brutal.  Just a long list of callouts by Louie on former Westsiders.

However, as someone who knew not a single person that lifted (better yet powerlifted) when I began training 11 months ago, and learned everything from how to DL less than 135 lbs to bring rice krispie treats to the meet online, I'm compelled to pay it forward. And possibly give someone in my shoes a year ago the push to sign tf up for a meet.


**Background**


After spending my entire adult life as a sad, lazy and obese stoner whose only fitness experience was 7th grade volleyball, I lost the weight for vanity reasons (70 lbs in 7 months). After about 50 lbs lost (summer 2019), I sat in a Planet Fitness parking lot 3 times before I got the guts to walk in just to get a membership (gyms be scary). The only thing I knew how to do was press start on the treadmill lol. After a few weeks of cardio machines and watching women that at the time I thought were so bad ass (the first time I saw a ""heavy"" hip thrust was when I realized there was more to the iron than jacked dudes mirin), I went to the gym at midnight and figured out how to use all the weight machines in solitude. Starting slowly subbing in machines for DBs a few weeks later while getting over my fear of looking like an idiot watching form vids on youtube. From the moment I did my first bicep curl with a DB (ofc that my first free weight lol), my entire shitty outlook on my weight and fitness changed. I hated cardio, why tf was I trying to run when I can just come to the gym and *lift weights.* Holding weight felt bad ass, and felt way better than working out to be skinny.


While down a late night reddit rabbithole, I learned what powerlifting was, about the supportive community, and that competition was mostly against yourself. I had never done any compounds, and never even gone anywhere near the PF smith machine, but it called to me. After a week of researching as much as someone who didn't know basic gym terminology can do, on September 28, 2019 I joined a gym with real equipment and started GZCLP. I threw myself into that shit, absorbing everything I could online and training 6 days/week (ez when your DL and squat are sub 100 lbs lol). I was incredibly fortunate to receive a random discord invite from someone on r/fitness within a few weeks that had some pretty knowledgeable people that gave me form advice and pointed me to more optimal resources. Training was fun, every single time, and gave me a purpose I had never had before. Quarantine hit, and by then I had made one friend that lifted and THEY HAD A GARAGE GYM. 2 12 week cycles into GZCLP in, I couldn't keep adding 5 lbs/week, and I knew it was in part due to form. I wasn't capable of teaching myself anymore. After reading every post here on how to evaluate a potential coach, I took the plunge 3.5 months ago and hired a well vetted local guy and he recommended this meet.


1RMs were last tested in May, 225 lb/105 lb/275 lb. No question that the squat and bench would not pass judges muster.


**Training**


2 12 week cycles of GZCLP with 2 T2s and 3 T3s every day, then programming from coach last 3.5 months. Second week with coach, I had a terrible flare up of long time sciatica which lasted the remainder of training. The pain prevented me from wearing a belt and DLing. I probably would have spiraled if I had to try to work through that on my own, but he made a physio recommendation and kept me training and pretty calm. Trained 4 days/week, squats twice (pin because the pain was pretty bad deep in the hole, and tempo, both no belt), bench or variation 4 days, and shit tons of heavy as I could manage RDLs. No DLs until about a month out, and that was mostly just testing very light singles to see how I was healing. While recovery was going well as far as my ADLs, it was slow for lifting...and I even tweaked my back further 2 weeks before the meet warming up at 185 lbs. Coach kept me focused and positive.


As to be expected, there was some MAJOR form tweaking when I first hired coach. I wasn't even consistently hitting depth and had no idea 🙈. Within a month, my lifts already looked exponentially cleaner. While I definitely did get stronger, I think the form improvements are the more appreciable benefit.


My peak programming was only 3 weeks, which was mostly more heavy singles, getting me back into a belt, and very light meet week. Obviously not much peaking is necessary for such a noob lol. Embarrassing admission….I shed a tear when I saw my name next to the word ""peak"" on a Google sheet 😅. 


Obviously everyone (including coach) advised to not cut weight for your first meet, but I was hovering at the cutoff for 72kg so I decided that I would be a 72kg (I'm finding this a good way to keep myself from overdoing it on the food and returning to old bad habits….I can't eat all the things, I exist as a 72kg. If I ever exist as anything else, it will be purposeful). Monday before the meet I weighed 160.8 lbs (72.94 kg). I ate low carb all week and limited water and salt on Thursday and Friday. 


**Meet Day**


Two weeks beforehand, I would nearly puke thinking about the meet. But that feeling was overpowered by the excitement as it got closer. I walked into that gym ready to rock….I had accepted that my back issues would hold me back, but I still had done everything I could do to prepare, missed only one training day in an entire year, and I just wanted to finally do this shit.


I rolled in to the 7 am weigh in hungry and thirsty but feeling good, and with my meet day starter pack (pedialyte, gatorade, chips, PB&J, homemade rice Krispy treats, and skittles - all tips found here and served me well, ty). The volunteers were especially helpful and friendly; I'm unsure whether this is commonplace or if extra kid gloves were used for us rookies. Weighed in at 71kg then got in line for rack heights while sipping on pedialyte and taking a few naproxen and tylenol. Sat and forced down a little of all the food while chatting with a few other ladies and doing mobility stuff. Being a rookie meet, we were all very much in the same boat, and having nearly 2 hours of hanging out before lifting began seemed to calm all of our nerves to some extent. Rules meeting 30 min before start, which was very thorough, including standards for the lifts (I get it, but couldn't help but think someone done fucked up if any of this is new to them lol).


Downed a heaping scoop of pwo before warmups. I don't feel like I got the full experience of how warmups could be. My coach kind of took over one rack and directed a handful of us taking turns warming up with the same weights. I can see how warmups could be a problem depending on the amount of equipment and if you don't have an aggressive coach that is going to take care of making sure you get the time you need. However, he didn't have me warm up much. Iirc my last warm up was a single of 78% of my opener. I was in the fucking zone, ear buds blasting while coach would point at the bar and hold up his fingers of how many reps to do. Nothing in the world existed or mattered except the massacre I was about to go on (this was my mental narrative lol). Realized right before that first attempt that I felt zero back or radiating pain... adrenaline apparently cures sciatica lol.


I had asked coach not to tell me my expected attempts, and I only learned of my openers at weigh in.


Being able to stay in the zone and not pay attention to the order was alone worth having coach there. After every lift in my flight, he'd just hold up fingers with how many out I was.

[Here's all the attempts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFDn1wfg8Pq/?igshid=1xt74vona0ezq)

⚪⚪⚪ 92.5 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 100 kg (idk what happened here, shouldn't have been so ugly...reason for conservative 3rd attempt)

⚪⚪⚪ 102.5 kg (1 lb PR, I love where I ask coach afterwards how much it was lol)


Watched the other flight squat and kept eating. Did a lot of cheering. Due to covid, we could only bring 2 ppl including coach. I don't even know who all these people yelling my name in all these vids are, twas a very small but very hyped group.


Bench warm ups flew, I blinked and it was time to lift. Ugh, my poverty bench….


⚪⚪🔴 42.5 kg (red light for ass coming up when bracing)

🔴⚪⚪ 45 kg (judge said wrong button pushed lol)

⚪⚪⚪ 47.5 kg (matched current 1RM)


More eating, pwo, sitting, and cheering. Why the hell am I genuinely so hyped for these ppl I just met or don't know? What an amazing atmosphere. 


I was dreading DLs. My once favorite and strongest lift was now my weakest and hadn't been trained in 3 months. I accepted mentally weeks ago that I would likely pull far below my 1rm. But, that last warm up flew *and there was no pain at all*. Every day in the week leading up to the meet, the pain was pretty bad in ADLs, so this was shocking.


⚪⚪⚪ 102.5 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 115 kg

⚪⚪⚪ 127.5 kg (6 lb PR, and fuck I'm happy. Coach actually put in for 125 kg, but switched it without telling me. I wish this vid lasted a few more seconds for when I start crying 🙈).


I lightly cried and entire body was slightly shaking for a few minutes, I didn't feel in control of it. I think it was a combo of happiness, exhaustion, adrenaline crash, and maybe some science/biology shit? The day was amazing, the meet itself was well done and very noob friendly, and it was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life.


While not huge PRs, I am absolutely thrilled with the numbers under the conditions. Being a retired couch potato, I feel good that I set a goal, consistently worked my ass off for 11 months, learned a sport, became somewhat competent in that sport, kept training through a pandemic and quarantine depression, AND kept going when there were days I could barely walk from this stupid sciatic nerve. I'm absolutely hooked, and getting into this has changed my life in sooooooo many ways. This is definitely a very healthy thing for how I view my weight/body...I wanna be and look strong, whatever form that takes, eating for fuel, etc. But ofc, I would be remiss if I didn't admit part of the PLing appeal is the embracing of food 😅.


If you actually read all of this, then you're the one person 9 months from now googling ""michigan rookie Rumble"" and deciding whether to register (yeah, that was me too lol). Fucking do it. There were people weaker than me, people stronger than me. Some people didn't have belt and/or sleeves, and a few had a custom belt. But, it didn't matter at all, that is the absolute truth, don't let your numbers or inexperience hold you back. People you just met will be screaming for you as grind out that 3rd attempt, regardless of what's on the bar. One tip I would give….if I didn't have a coach attending with me, I would hire a handler for the day (maybe a coach that will already be there with another athlete?). I could have done this without him, but there are a fair amount of moving parts that would be a big distraction from what you're there to do….move weight. Coach loaded all warm ups for me and told me how many reps to do (and he made sure we had a rack to do them on, legit concern). He let me know when my time to go was coming; otherwise I would've been squinting at a screen periodically while trying to stay in the zone. You have to put your next attempt in as you leave the platform...good luck making that decision, and converting to kgs quickly if you're murican lol. Coach made every decision for me and put in attempts while I did things like, go pee. I can't stress enough how much weight this takes off your shoulders.


If any of you actual regular users of this sub actually made it to the end, THANK YOU. While I now have a coach and am at a powerlifting gym (still have to give myself a pep talk before walking in, convince myself I belong there lol), this sub has been one of primary sources of information and has taught me who the good/bad resources are, especially while chugging along by myself at my chain gym. I'm still so so so weak and have sooooooo much to learn, but I swear to fucking God, I will be competitive-ish in masters in 2 years 💪😤

Edit: I should've waited to post until I could ask his permission to name drop, but my coach is Dane Roach, USAPL state co-chair and ref, coaches some seriously strong people (obviously not referring to myself 😂), and one hell of an awesome dude. You can find him through my IG post above.",powerlifting,"[FIRST MEET REPORT] USAPL Michigan Rookie Rumble 9/12/20 | 37F | 277.5 kg @ 71 kg | 273 wilks | total noob to meet in 11 months I'm hesitant to post this, as come on, how interesting is an old lady benching 105 lbs lol. However, as someone who knew not a single person that lifted (better yet powerlifted) when I began training 11 months ago, and learned everything from how to DL less than 135 lbs to bring rice krispie treats to the meet online, I'm compelled to pay it forward. And possibly give someone in my shoes a year ago the push to sign tf up for a meet.


**Background**


After spending my entire adult life as a sad, lazy and obese stoner whose only fitness experience was 7th grade volleyball, I lost the weight for vanity reasons (70 lbs in 7 months). After about 50 lbs lost (summer 2019), I sat in a Planet Fitness parking lot 3 times before I got the guts to walk in just to get a membership (gyms be scary). The only thing I knew how to do was press start on the treadmill lol. After a few weeks of cardio machines and watching women that at the time I thought were so bad ass (the first time I saw a ""heavy"" hip thrust was when I realized there was more to the iron than jacked dudes mirin), I went to the gym at midnight and figured out how to use all the weight machines in solitude. Starting slowly subbing in machines for DBs a few weeks later while getting over my fear of looking like an idiot watching form vids on youtube. From the moment I did my first bicep curl with a DB (ofc that my first free weight lol), my entire shitty outlook on my weight and fitness changed. I hated cardio, why tf was I trying to run when I can just come to the gym and *lift weights.* Holding weight felt bad ass, and felt way better than working out to be skinny.


While down a late night reddit rabbithole, I learned what powerlifting was, about the supportive community, and that competition was mostly against yourself. I had never done any compounds, and never even gone anywhere near the PF smith machine, but it called to me. After a week of researching as much as someone who didn't know basic gym terminology can do, on September 28, 2019 I joined a gym with real equipment and started GZCLP. I threw myself into that shit, absorbing everything I could online and training 6 days/week (ez when your DL and squat are sub 100 lbs lol). I was incredibly fortunate to receive a random discord invite from someone on r/fitness within a few weeks that had some pretty knowledgeable people that gave me form advice and pointed me to more optimal resources. Training was fun, every single time, and gave me a purpose I had never had before. Quarantine hit, and by then I had made one friend that lifted and THEY HAD A GARAGE GYM. 2 12 week cycles into GZCLP in, I couldn't keep adding 5 lbs/week, and I knew it was in part due to form. I wasn't capable of teaching myself anymore. After reading every post here on how to evaluate a potential coach, I took the plunge 3.5 months ago and hired a well vetted local guy and he recommended this meet.


1RMs were last tested in May, 225 lb/105 lb/275 lb. No question that the squat and bench would not pass judges muster.

1. DON’T VIOLATE OUR LIFTERS

Most volunteers are first time and young women. I’m the biggest volunteer so the organizer points at me and says, “For squats, we need \*you\* to back spot the women.” Uh, I train at home and I don’t spot anybody on anything, let alone women at a meet.

“First flight is up in 5 minutes.” My eyes widen and a flash of fear strews across my face as the organizer pats my back, “You look strong, you got this buddy.”

My first concern, “How do you spot women without touching their…”

“Well,” the organizer crosses his arms, “You signed the liability waiver, so if you touch them inappropriately and get sued, that’s \*your\* problem.”

He flashes a smile, “Kidding!” He demonstrates how to spot and his wife adds, “The lifters \*know\* what they signed up for. They’re depending on \*you\* for their safety. Just \*grab\* them."" (“Them” being the women themselves I assume, and not their… )

First woman is up. “First attempt. Nice light opener” I think, trying to calm myself. “No way she’ll miss this. Will give me a chance to find my positioning and get a bit more comfortable.”

Nope. She wobbles backward as a judge shouts “Take it!” I catch her and we get the bar on the rack. She thanks me and pats my shoulder.

""You’re welcome” I say as I smile back at her. “And thank you for weighing only 57 kg.” (I didn’t say the last part.)

2. CONTROVERSY

A young woman benches a national record and is having her clothing examined in front of me by the head referee.

“What is \*this\*?” he interrogates as he pulls the shirt underneath her singlet. She says nothing but looks at him… innocently? Disingenuously? Conspiratorially? “Spandex” he mutters.

She stands frozen, expressionless, like a deer caught in headlights.

“Uh…” the ref sighs, taking a deep breath. He doesn’t want this predicament. “Your shirt is \*supposed\* to be 100% cotton. We covered this at the athletes' meeting. But if they approved \*this\* shirt at your equipment check, well…”

“She was wearing a \*different\* shirt at the athletes' meeting” someone says but I don’t know if the ref hears.

Her lift is approved but she’s admonished harshly and I’m pretty sure we’ll never see her in that shirt again for like the rest of her life.

3. THE MAGICIAN

Fast forward to deadlifts and next up is… Spandex Girl, back for another attempt with, well, spandex. “Nope” the head ref bellows. The other refs look at him. “It’s her shirt. She’s been told \*twice already\*” he explains in the tone you’d use with your toddler when you catch her with her hand in the cookie jar, again, trying to steal yet another cookie before dinner. “You have 45 seconds left to lift. And not with that shirt.”

If you believe women take a long time to get dressed, you’ve never met \*this\* woman. There’s a curtain separating the warmup area from the platform. Behind the curtain she disappears and then like a magician, emerges seconds later with bare arms and chest underneath her singlet. “How did she do that?” I murmur in wonder. She smokes her lift.

",powerlifting,"Mark Bell's PowerCast has ended per Jim McDonald Massenomics stated in a post on instagram today that Mark Bell's PowerCast is finished, and Jim McDonald is no longer associated with Mark Bell.

Jim McD stated as much in the comments of his most recent instagram post 2 days ago.

[Combined results spreadsheet](http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=09851933032705218288)

[English Survey CSV Results (Raw data)](https://pastebin.com/E6uydsBW)

[Metric Survey CSV Results (Raw Data)](https://pastebin.com/YgRTeREs)

The combined results have some edited data to make everything agree with each other: Height is listed in inches rather than inch/feet and cm, and protein consumption results were converted to g/lb instead of g/kg (There was also an error in the original survey where I divided protein numbers rather than multiplied, so some results are messed up).  Lastly obvious lies and unit errors were corrected.  

**Original Post:**

The results are in!  After spending way too many nights after work dicking around with the data in Excel, I tossed together some nice charts.

#[Link to results album](https://imgur.com/a/ozbvt8W)

Apologies in advance for poorly labelled axis.  Going through this many charts gets tedious, but the data should be easy to understand.

[Link to Excel spreadsheet that I used](https://send.firefox.com/download/1c5d9f8209/#icjzEF6M7H-nWt72islN0g)  It was made by combining the metric and English results into a single spreadsheet.  Height has been converted to inches.  Obvious errors such as metric responses to English survey and vice-versa were corrected or removed. 

Note: Firefox required for download, capped at 20 downloads.  If anyone knows of a better way to anonymously share that data, please let me know.

- Congrats to /u/Mhb30: the strongest user who chose to identify himself with a Wilks of 556

- Congrats to /u/tovero: the strongest female user with a wilks of 505

- The strongest natty and enhanced lifters have wilks scores of 564 and 585 respectively

I hope to keep this going for years to come and maybe ask some more and better questions next time around.

At the first meeting, they told him to drop out of the Corrupted Strength meet as it's not IPF-affiliated. Second meeting, they asked him to sign up for an IPF membership as his had lapsed since the Trinidad federation has had issues with the IPF over the last couple years and he hasn't been able to compete with them. Then, on the day of the Corrupted Strength meet, the IPF issued a 1 year suspension to Rondel ostensibly for the Gameday Barbell meet back in April that they already knew about.

The only reading of this is the IPF manipulated Rondel with the promise of Sheffield into dropping out of a meet, paying for a membership, then suspended him after it was too late to re-enter the meet. They knew they were going to suspend him, but pretended to offer the biggest money meet to him anyway. This is some corrupt, unethical shit by the IPF, which may not surprise many people.

I've been thinking about this for quite some time and I've come to realize this is my favorite thing about powerlifting. 

In all of the popular sports, I have not seen any that the fans and athletes are as interested in the opposite genders division as much as powerlifting. Everyone loves and appreciates every weight class regardless of men's or women's division. Also female athletes get just as much coverage in powerlifting media and are getting sponsors just like their male counterparts which is not at all the case for other sports. This is especially interesting to me as it appears to many people as a testosterone raging toxic male sport but in fact it is the furthest from this

Won silver overall and gold in squat with a Junior World Record. Felt like putting down some thoughts about the whole experience so this is it. Heads up it's pretty long.**

**Hella Background**

At Raw Nats 2016 I made the Jr. USA team and shortly after I injured my back causing me to drop out. During Raw Nats 2017,  I was just excited to compete again and wasn’t even thinking about making the team. I missed the spot by coming 7 kgs short— a difference I knew I could’ve beat. I went on to compete at the Arnold’s totaling 425 kgs– the same total as the 63 kg Jr. who first a few months later at 2018 World’s. At this point I felt like I was really capable of making the team again based on strength, so that and the fact that it’d be my last chance (too old) drove the vigor during my Raw Nats 2018 prep. 

During my prep I realized there were some new faces—more 63 kg juniors competing and there would be tough competition for that spot. Jasmyn Penn being one of them was a tank and I knew I would have to do really, really well to beat her. Unfortunately, she was way stronger than I had imagined day of and I performed nothing close to as hoped. I left the competition thinking I’d be lucky to have the top spot on the alternate team. 

February came along and I got the invite to be on the alternate team and to my surprise I was first on the list. A couple weeks later I was officially invited to be on the Jr. team. Part of me was excited for the opportunity, but to be honest I knew I was most likely to come in second to Jasmyn and that gave me a mixture of emotions—sad, scared, discouraged, etc. 
 
**Meet Prep**

I finally got under the bar again in January, under James Vang (new coach under Team Rohr Powerlifting), after staying away from the big 3 since October. Prep was a mix of very high volume and intensity. Always conscious of my back injuries I never really took on such volume in the past. It was nice to see that I was able to handle my programming. However, a few weeks in I started getting some pain in my hips that I immediately knew it was serious. April and May were filled with appointments and I eventually found out I tore my left hip labrum. Devasted I mentally gave up on the competition. What kept me going was that fact that I was only a few weeks out and I figured I can still go for the experience. In a way knowing I probably wasn’t going to get first took off some pressure. 

**Weight**

Since my last competition was in October, it had been a while since cutting. I was sitting at 150 lbs for a few months and after I injured my hip, I lost motivation to take my cut seriously. The end of May came and I was around 148 lbs. At this point I was internally freaking out a lot and reached out to James. We came up with a plan and strictly timed my meals and cut calories. On June 1 I was 144 lbs and started my water cut. I left for Sweden weighing around 142 lbs on Thursday and Saturday morning weighed around 140 lbs. The rest of the day consisted of spitting, hot baths, and the sauna. By the time it was the evening I was 63.25 kgs— felt a little better about making weight so I ate a small meal. Woke up day of competition at 62.7 kgs so drank some water with Emergen-C and ate some pre-weighed out food. Made weight at 62.8 kgs. 

**Few days before**

Last workout was on Wednesday, June 5. Leading up to the competition I felt prepared. The pain in my hips had subsided enough for me squat normally for the last 2 weeks of prep. 

Day before competition I was hearing about how harshly depth was being judged. I watched some of the live stream, dumbstruck by some of the calls. Aware of that I told myself that the only way I could win was on technicalities. I eventually decided to check out the venue to see what the equipment was like and get a feel for how things would go to kill time. The remainder of the night was me lying awake nervous until midnight. 

**Day of**

Knowing I was underweight morning of I was ready to go for the day. I had studied the judging and seen the venue before, so all that was left was to put everything on the platform. 

[**Squats**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BylWiKsgrUH/)

I made it clear to Eric Bodhorn (handler for the day) that I wanted to play it safe with squats. He told me that the plan was to go for the World Record attempt on my second, but Jasmyn Penn (other 63 kg Jr from USA) was probably opening with it. However, at that point I told Eric more than chasing the record I just wanted to stay in the competition and let things play out. I knew I had to bury my squats and with warm ups feeling fine I decided to keep my opening attempt. 

1.	155 kg/341 lbs – I was worried going in due to my labrum tear, but once I got the white lights, I felt safe to at least have this lift secured. 
2.	[165.5 kg/364 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byglf4sggtl/) (Jr. World Record)– I told Eric not to tell me my attempts. I ended up hitting this lift, interestingly getting red lighted on the opposite side of my injury. Didn’t even know it was a world record until after. 
3.	168 kg/370 lbs – My second squat took a toll on me, so we decided to make a small jump. I somehow pushed through but knew as I came up I definitely didn’t go low enough to the judges standards. 

Overall I know I was held back by my tear, but glad that I had enough in me to secure the world record. Unfortunately, depth got to the best of my fellow teammate and at this point gold was up for grabs. 

[**Bench**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BynrBf2AJsq/)

Going into bench I didn’t have much expectations other than keeping me on track to win. Coming in I had the highest squat, so I stuck with conservative numbers. I was really hoping to finally hit over 200 lbs in competition, but that was not the day. I was not a fan at all of the carpet on the platform— super slippery. Also, the people giving hand-offs did not understand my instructions (seemed to be some language issues) and pretty much just dropped the bar at the wrong cue each time.

1.	 85 kg/ 187 lbs – Right from the first bench I knew I probably wasn’t going to hit a pr. I had told the head spotter to count 3..2..1 and give the hand-off and he just dropped the bar on the first count. 
2.	90 kg/198 lbs – I had hit this weight before so felt okay going in as a second attempt. This lift ended up being steady and smooth. 
3.	92.5 kg/203.5 lb – Before the lift I was having so much trouble keeping my feet planted. You can see me shuffle just trying to get into position. Unfortunately, I think not being able to keep tight really prevented me from pushing further on this lift. The weight just stagnated midway until I gave up.

After bench I saw that competition was catching up. I had done what I could however and was not worried about the 2.5 kgs lost from missing my third bench. I think we truly used my capacity. 

[**Deadlift**](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByqKQngAcPM/)

Strategically I typically open light for deadlifts and end with a pr. From my most recent competitions though I had lost confidence in my deadlifts—consistently missing anything about 400 lbs, which has been my goal for the past 2 years. As deadlifts began, I saw that the projected totals were very close between me, Italy, and Norway. I honestly thought I still had a chance at gold, but if needed I would have to pull for the win. 

1.	165 kg/363 lbs – This was a confident start for me. Weight I knew I could easily move. I was a little worried about the sudden weight cut I did taking a toll, but the energy seemed to be there. 
2.	177.5 kg/390.5 lbs – I think at this point Eric was strategically calculating my attempts to stay close to the competition. I also had this lift easy but knew it wasn’t enough to win. At this point I knew only 400+ would get me first place and I thought it’d take a miracle to do that. 
3.	[190 kg/418 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByhRGveggXB/) – In order to win I knew I had to pull this lift and Italy had to fail on her third. I didn’t know the weight on the bar but did the math and knew it had to be something significant for me to catch up. Right before I went up, Eric told me in my ear this was the pull for gold. I have never, NEVER, been so hungry for a deadlift before and I went up to the platform to do my thing. As the bar came up, I let out a smile and breathe of air in relief and shock that I did it. I think because I wasn’t used to the weight, my right leg had wobbled a little bit, but I continued with the lift leaning back to show I had pulled it completely. I put the bar down thinking this was it and to my shock I got 2 red lights from the middle and left. 

After my last deadlift everything happened so fast. Team USA went to go contest the lift, but with them already trying to contest Jasmyn’s squat and losing I didn’t have much hope. Also, these judges required money just to be spoken to- some bullshit that it takes $100 just to review a lift. They like to call this sport fair right? I waited patiently in the back, and in this time Italy had failed her last lift which meant if I had only gotten one more white light I would have been the overall champion. I cannot put into words how frustrated I was in this moment and still to this day it bothers me. From what I know, and only those there to review the lift can correct me but apparently the head secretary or someone said the lift was fine but the judges said there was downward motion. If you watch the lift you can easily see that this was not the case and I know the rule book allows for settling of the bar and wobbling of the foot, as long as it does not leave the ground. If Heather Connor’s (btw I think her lift was fine, added her name in reference to a comparison on an earlier ipf world’s thread) and [insert Swedish lifter who didn’t even lock out] got white lights I don’t really understand the discrepancy. I understand judges are human beings but on the international level, no offense there really shouldn’t be room for something so apparent. Honestly think it’s sad and frustrating that the judges don’t uphold the IPF standards. At least for squat they were harsh on everyone, for this deadlift I’m the one who lost out. If I had gotten this deadlift I would’ve not only won, but also finally hit over 400 lbs with a massive pr and increased my total by 20 kgs. 

**Aftermath**

I have to admit that I’ve definitely put on a fake smile at times saying I’m happy with the results. If I’m going to be honest, I know what I am capable of and that’s what I put on the platform. Just disappointing to see that didn’t yield the results I had hoped. I know at the end of the day if Jasmyn was in the competition or the Italian girl hit her third deadlift, I wouldn’t have gotten gold anyways, but in my opinion, those were better reasons to come in second than what happened. Part of me feels like I basically paid $1K (USAPL doesn’t provide shit) to get slapped in the face by the IPF. When looking back at this competition I’m just finding it hard to see my glass half full than empty. 

On the flip side, I’ve had a countless amount of people telling me how proud they are and that I’m an inspiration. This is what has really been helping me get past my cup half empty situation. I really am thankful for all the kind comments I’ve received after World’s and just the opportunity to represent the USA among so many lifters.   

**Future** 

I really wanted to start oly after the competition, but now with my labrum tear I’ve just been doing more bodybuilding style workouts and giving myself rest. Short-term need to figure out what to do with my hip and long-term regain that love I had for powerlifting when I first started.",powerlifting,"[Very Delayed Meet Report] 2019 IPF World's – 22 F, 433 kg at 62.8 kg, 466/754 Wilks, Silver Medal Overall, Gold in Squats w/ Jr. World Record **TL;DR Little late but competed for Team USA in 63 kg Jr. at World’s and went 6/9.

I have to admit that I’ve definitely put on a fake smile at times saying I’m happy with the results. If I’m going to be honest, I know what I am capable of and that’s what I put on the platform. Just disappointing to see that didn’t yield the results I had hoped. I know at the end of the day if Jasmyn was in the competition or the Italian girl hit her third deadlift, I wouldn’t have gotten gold anyways, but in my opinion, those were better reasons to come in second than what happened. Part of me feels like I basically paid $1K (USAPL doesn’t provide shit) to get slapped in the face by the IPF. When looking back at this competition I’m just finding it hard to see my glass half full than empty. 

On the flip side, I’ve had a countless amount of people telling me how proud they are and that I’m an inspiration. This is what has really been helping me get past my cup half empty situation. I really am thankful for all the kind comments I’ve received after World’s and just the opportunity to represent the USA among so many lifters.   

**Future** 

I really wanted to start oly after the competition, but now with my labrum tear I’ve just been doing more bodybuilding style workouts and giving myself rest. Short-term need to figure out what to do with my hip and long-term regain that love I had for powerlifting when I first started."

However, as many of you know, I'm not overly fond of those reviews, as Izzy has never even had any experience training with most of the programs he has reviewed, is really not that experienced himself as a lifter, and is heavily biased towards RPE based programs. And I know I am not alone in these criticisms either.

So, that said, I want to replace the recommended program list with a new set of program reviews based upon the experiences and knowledge of people who have actually run those programs, and to do this I was hoping to get the sub to help and make it a sort of community project.

My plan is that in the coming week I'll sticky a post with a small review criteria template in the title post and top comment headers for a whole lot of popular powerlifting programs, and what I am asking is that anyone who has personally used these programs give their reviews and opinions on them (as opposed to Izzy's list of programs he's never tried and why any of them that don't use RPE suck). And I'll also allow certain top lifters and coaches to give their opinions on others that they may not have tried but at least have some sort of educated opinion of.

bn05pg,1557504556.0,Machine Learning to Analyze OpenPowerlifting Data,"EDIT: Gold? lolwut?!? Thank you!! I’m so glad people are interested in this silly homework project - thanks so much for the love, powerlifting friends!

Hi everyone!  I put something in the daily thread recently to gauge interest in a full post, and folks seemed enthusiastic about my project, so here it is:

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I wrote a machine learning project where I got to look at data from OpenPowerlifting for a graduate physics course, and I thought you folks may be interested to check it out!

&#x200B;

Okay, so some background – I’m a physics PhD student in the US with very little coding background and absolutely no prior machine learning experience.  This semester, my university offered a ML course that sounded really cool, so I figured it was worth a shot.  Unfortunately, when final project time rolled around, I realized that my work (magnetic phase transitions, magnetocaloric materials, and thermomagnetic power generation) is not very well-suited to these sorts of techniques without some serious thought.  So, my professor gave me permission to analyze the data available [here](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/data) from the OpenPowerlifting project.

&#x200B;

The purpose of this project is to try to apply some machine learning techniques to the incredibly vast and absolutely fantastic dataset compiled by the good folks at OpenPowerlifting (seriously, you people are the greatest for doing this amazing thing).  I decided to focus on lifter classifications (Elite, Master, Class I, …, Class V) and predictive modeling of best lifts at a meet based on pre-entered first attempts.  (That way, the “projected total” you sometimes see on the scoreboard at meets will be rooted in decades of data!)  

&#x200B;

A little detail on the code, now: I chose to write it using MATLAB (booooo MATLAB boooo) because (1) I have a student license so why not use it, and (2) I have some experience with MATLAB and next to none with Python.  So, I thought it would be best to learn ML techniques within a framework I already understand.  (I know that OCTAVE is very similar to MATLAB except that it costs $0, but I have no idea if the ML functions I use exist in OCTAVE).  Now that we addressed the elephant in the room, let’s talk code.

&#x200B;

The first, and longest, thing to do is read in the data.  I accessed the OpenPowerlifting data on May 1, 2019, and the .CSV file is approximately 250 MB in size.  So, reading that into an array takes \~2 min on my laptop (2015 MacBook Pro, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 processor).  Then, data is sorted depending on the specific group you’d like to analyze.  Options I’ve included are sex, equipment, event, and division – that way, you compare “like” with “like” as much as possible.  Lifters are manually segmented into modern IPF weight class distinctions (sorry, it’s nothing personal…) in order to attempt to eliminate the discrepancy in weight classes between federations.

&#x200B;

Once data is finally sorted out, we can start the fun stuff.  First, I use k-means clustering to categorize lifters in each weight class as either Elite, Master, Class I, … or Class V.  Practically, this consists of me creating matrices of total versus bodyweight for each class and feeding these matrices into the “kmeans” function for k=7 clusters.  Behind the scenes, the algorithm determines where to locate cluster centers based on the data distribution, and then each data point is assigned to only one cluster.  These results can be seen both graphically as well as in table form [here](https://imgur.com/a/SQlbNAc).

&#x200B;

Then, I made [plots](https://imgur.com/a/pCWWSET) of first attempt versus third attempt for each lift for each weight class – a total of 24 plots for the men and 21 for the women.  From each of these distributions, I trained a linear regression model using 30% holdout of validation data.  The model I chose was a Ridge regression, which essentially mans the algorithm will impose a “penalty” to data points that are particularly far away from the mean in addition to the usual least-squares method of data fitting.  This is especially important for certain points where there is an apparent first attempt of \~20 kg and a third attempt over 200 kg higher!  It's worth mentioning that the slope of each line produced by the regression represents the extent to which effects change as a function of strength (i.e. do the same trends apply for stronger lifters, or does the effect change?) and the intercept is the average ""jump"" from first attempt to best attempt.  As such, the bottom of the group of points represents those lifters for whom the first attempt was also their heaviest successful attempt, and lifters - on average - increase by the intercept value to their best successful attempt.

&#x200B;

Finally, I needed some way to evaluate the performance of the models on test data.  So the last 24 (for men) and 21 (for women) [plots](https://imgur.com/a/5trqbUH) represent the relationship between the third attempts predicted by the model with the actual third attempts of lifters with corresponding first attempts from the validation set.  Although the fit is not a perfect one-to-one prediction (which would be a tall task with such noisy data), there is still a strong correlation between what the model predicts and how lifters actually perform, as shown by the symmetric line of best fit and seemingly low variance in the performance plots.

&#x200B;

That’s basically it!  If you’re interested, I posted the MATLAB script [here](https://github.com/brofessormcgonagall/openpowerlifting), and if you see something that could be made better (which I almost guarantee you will see plenty), feel free to make any tweaks that could make things work more smoothly.  And if you’re actually good with machine learning, hopefully this will motivate you to take the barebones analysis I’ve done and run with it to make some really impressive contributions to both ML and powerlifting data analytics.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and see what kind of discussion this sparks, and thanks for reading, everybody!",powerlifting,"Machine Learning to Analyze OpenPowerlifting Data EDIT: Gold? lolwut?!?

If you’re interested, I posted the MATLAB script [here](https://github.com/brofessormcgonagall/openpowerlifting), and if you see something that could be made better (which I almost guarantee you will see plenty), feel free to make any tweaks that could make things work more smoothly.  And if you’re actually good with machine learning, hopefully this will motivate you to take the barebones analysis I’ve done and run with it to make some really impressive contributions to both ML and powerlifting data analytics.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and see what kind of discussion this sparks, and thanks for reading, everybody!"
6i2t17,1497828654.0,Meet Report: 33 year old father of two over eats and competes in weight class he doesn't belong in.,"June 17th Dungeon Fitness Summer Strength Classic. Bremerton, WA. 1697 total at 270 Thick, Gelatinous, and Loose pounds.

My Training:

I last competed in 2008 and those were only push/pull meets. Since then I have been fluctuating between sedentarily obese and moderately fit. In late 2105 my Dr. said, ""Look bro, you're super fat and I don't want you to die...lose some weight."" Or it least something to that effect. I bought a home gym, trained 4 times a week for 6 months and went from 300 lbs to 237 lbs. In short, I won...so I could quit, right? Well, I did and went full sedentary again. Fast forward 9 months...got a bit fatter, sold the home gym, and went back to an athletic club.

Training around others is a problem for me. One, I naturally don't like to train for 'fitness' reasons. Two, seeing people lift weights heavier than me makes me furious. The fury lead to me becoming a powerlifter again. So I hopped on stronglifts 5*5 to get prepped for this meet. Before 14 weeks ago I had not lifted a weight heavier than 315 in any lift for over 8 years. The strength came back very quickly. I jumped my progression about 6 weeks halfway through. 10 weeks in I was feeling strong, but struggling with some unfamiliar pain (left hip, biceps, elbows) and depth issues that had me seek out a coach. I found Beefpuff Barbell and felt like it was a good culture and approach match. They brought my stance in, put my in heels, and got me on the mobility train. Also, full disclosure I have been on TRT (200 mg/wk) for 4 ish years. I was lifetime drug-free before that and found I had a T level of 300 in my late 20s. I will likely go further down the rabbit hole from this point forward.

The Meet:

First - great meet. Great judging, great crowd, great lifters, great atmosphere. Lots of first timers and some were incredibly strong. I could not have had more fun. My 10 year old daughter enjoyed the show and filmed most of my lifts.

Squat - https://instagram.com/p/BVfucmYlUDE/ - 3/3. Warm ups went well and so did my attempts. I only got two on film, my opener and my second. Opened at 501 and it was easy. Took my second at 551 and it was equally as easy. Third at 584 was slightly more difficult, but no problem. I left weight on the platform here, but the conservative approach was deliberate. I went a bit over my programmed attempts because everything felt so smooth. I rebuilt (my coach did) squat form in three weeks and was happy with my performance. 584 got only two whites and I expected as much coming out of the hole. I knew my depth was borderline. Never squatted in a meet, so obviously PRs

Bench - https://instagram.com/p/BVfvlq6l00d/ - 3/3. Legit hate this lift. Because of my mobility work and adrenaline I wasn't experiencing brutal bicep pain. So, this went better than expected. I feel like I got really slow start and press commands, but I am a bit shaky at the top so benefit of the doubt to the judges. 375, 395, and a sloppy (uneven ish) 407.9. Last two on video. The way squats were brutalizing my elbows in training I didn't expect to make it past my opener. Incredibly happy with these numbers and hoping to actually bench press acceptable weight in the future. PR on all three attempts.

Deadlift - https://instagram.com/p/BVf3eG1F15q/ - 2/3. Party time. I just like to deadlift. Shut the brain off, neutral spine, and get some. 661 opener easy as pie. 705 second went up easily, but I misgrooved it and also either pulled my calf or it cramped up really bad at the top. Literally shocked my calf is the part of me that comes out of this meet beat up. 727 third got 2 reds for a hitch. I knew I either got caught by some bar whip or hitched, so I wasn't surprised. The disappointment comes because my coaches had been riding me to use baby powder and I blew them off. Baby powder (and a singlet with a less dramatic lip in the leg hole) and this lift wasn't a problem. In the end, I got it up and my grip was nowhere near failing. Last two attempts filmed, poor quality on the 727, but enough to critique form. PRs all around.

Total: 8/9 1697. Won my class and best lifter for the meet. Nice $50 SBD gift certificate.

I can't wait to see what my coach programs for the future. I want my weight down around 242 soonish so I can compete in that class. Ultimately I'd like to get within cutting distance of 220 or be 250 solid pounds and lift in the 242 class.

End of year goals: Compete in another meet at 242 and squat at least 650, bench 430, and deadlift 800. Also, don't get injured.

I know this meet is a bit of a meme, but it's bringing powerlifting out to a wider audience, and let's be honest, there's not exactly an overflow of big events going on in powerlifting at the moment. 

Plus it is featuring at least some notable Powerlifters, like everyone's favourite uncle Ben Rice!

So let's join in on the fun, hype our favourite lifters in chat, and have this thread serve as everyone's one stop shop for discussion of the event.

Here's a rough table of competitors and their lifts I shamelessly stole from /u/goldsolace's comment in the initial announcement thread. Big props for taking the effort to make it.

kajjcm,1607620964.0,"Interview with Ashton Rouska, the #2 all-time tested lifter in the world regardless of weight class.","## Ashton Rouska  
  
*At the time of this interview on October 24, 2020, Ashton Rouska held the #7 all-time ranking in powerlifting for drug-tested lifters across all weight classes with a 920 kg (2,028.2 lb) total at a bodyweight of 99.1 (218.4). Shortly after this interview, he rose to the #2 all-time ranking, totaling 950.5 kg (2,095.5 lb) at 98.4 (217), with a Dots score of 589.06.*  
  
**Michael Chernin:** How old are you and how long have you been training?  
  
**Ashton Rouska:** I'm twenty-three years old right now. I've been training since I was thirteen years old, and I've actually been powerlifting since I was sixteen years old.  
  
**MC:** How did you initially get into training?  
  
**AR:** During that time, I was getting into martial arts and sports and everything else, so I got into the weight room, and that's where I started actually lifting weights.  
  
**MC:** How did you get into powerlifting from that?  
  
**AR:** At the end of my sophmore year of high school, one of my wrestling coaches approached me and told me I should try a state powerlifting meet. Of course, then, I had no idea what it really all entailed. I had been watching videos of people lifting weights heavy and training videos at that point, anyway, so I thought, why not give it a good shot? I did the meet, feel in love with it, and have been competing since.  
  
**MC:** What are your most significant accomplishments? I know you just put together a monster total at a USAPL meet.  
  
**AR:** I would say, I remember when I won Open Raw Nationals in 2017. I was twenty years old in the 205 class. Also, back in '14, I won the IPF equipped Junior World Championship in the 183 pound weight class. I would say those two meets in particular and then the way that I won them stand out to me the most out of all the meets I've competed in.  
  
**MC:** How so?  
  
**AR:** I would also say 2019 Collegiate Nationals, my senior year of undergrad, when I won that meet in the 231 weight class weighing, I think, 206. I had a 1,930 total that day and just absolutely destroyed that day.  
  
**MC:** You recently destroyed the competition at your most recent meet as well, right?  
  
**AR:** Yeah, I was planning to train that day anyway and lift those weights. I heard there was a meet, and I thought I might as well make the two thousand-plus total official, so I went ahead and signed up for it about four days out.  
  
**MC:** Congratulations on getting that done!  
  
**AR:** Thank you! I got my next one three weeks from today.  
  
**MC:** When you were a beginner to lifting weights, powerlifting, how did you train?  
  
**AR:** I did a lot of hypertrophy, a lot of high volume, and I would lift to failure quite a bit. It's probably a miracle that I didn't get injured a lot more, but I pushed myself really, really hard those first couple years, day in and day out.  
  
**MC:** How did you first learn what you needed to? Did you have a coach or a lifting mentor, or are you self-taught?  
  
**AR:** That depends on the time period. Sometimes there were a couple coaches along the way. They weren't my actual coaches, but they were the coaches for the athletic teams I participated for, and I would do strength and conditioning training with some of the plans they would give me. I would modify some of the plans for myself, I would add or remove weights depending on how I felt, and I looked into a lot of different weight training methods. But, you know, being a thirteen or fourteen year old boy, I just wanted to hit it every day and get really big and strong.  
  
**MC:** How did you build your psychological skills for training to the level that you've gotten yourself to?  
  
**AR:** Well, the way that I saw it was at the end of the day my goal was, and still is, to be as strong as I possibly can, and every session, whether I feel good or bad, has meaning. It has value attached to that goal in some meaningful way. So every session is important. Every session matters. No matter how big or small. The bigger ones are funner, sure, but smaller ones still contribute to the ultimate goal. When it comes to breaking limits and barriers psychologically, I usually try not to get myself psyched up too much, but I definitely get into the zone, and I can get pretty intense at times. It's kind of like a switch that I have. I flip that switch, and once I do, I feel stronger. I feel much stronger.  
  
**MC:** Are you normally a pretty calm lifter, or do you need to get amped up for the big lifts that you do?  
  
**AR:** I would say that's evolved over time and it changes. Sometimes I'm very intense, very amped up. Sometimes, like now, I'm a bit more, I don't think ""calm"" is the right word, I think more so ""collected."" ""Composed"" is a better way to put it. I definitely still bring intensity, but I'm more composed now. Rather than just raw aggression, raw hype, it's much more channeled and focused now.  
  
**MC:** Yeah, people that start out as very emotional lifters usually become a lot more collected over time, from what I've seen.  
  
**AR:** Oh yeah, absolutely, and I think you'll see that a lot with the younger athletes anyway, just because they're young, they're getting into it, they're excited. It's totally normal. I'll say it's a shared experience.  
  
**MC:** What are some mistakes you've made throughout your training career or any regrets that you have?  
  
**AR:** Remember earlier how I said that every training session, no matter how big or small, contributes to the ultimate goal in some way? I don't regret any of my sessions. I don't regret any of the injuries that I've experienced, because they've all contributed to where I'm at now or where I'm going. I will say there are mistakes made along the way. Close to the beginning, when I was really excited, and I was just pushing and pushing and pushing, it got to the point where I got hurt pretty bad towards the end of high school. For three, four years after that, some of the areas that were hurt, I would definitely feel pain there while I was lifting. I was able to manage it pretty well and keep pushing, and once I hit the last year or so I began to prioritize things a little bit differently. The ultimate goal is to still get as strong as I possibly can, but I realized that in order to accomplish that, I have to be as healthy as possible. So I've really focused a lot on maintaining good health and prioritizing my health throughout all my training now. And it's evident with the things I've been able to do.  
  
**MC:** Has it gotten easier over time to prioritize the staying healthy versus going to the limit every session, or is that still challenging?  
  
**AR:** It's gotten a lot easier for me because, like I was explaining earlier, every session has a purpose, and you have to keep in mind what the purpose of that session is. If the purpose of that session is to get blood flow, just do some pump work, or if that session is to lift really heavy, to move weight that's really close to the max, that session should build it. Every session has its purpose, and I always try to keep that purpose in mind. When I do, I'm a lot more adept to navigating my training a lot better, and I see a lot of success.  
  
**MC:** Does the purpose of the session ever evolve during the session itself, or do you usually have the purpose decided before you even go to the gym?  
  
**AR:** Nine times out of ten, it's decided before I even go to the gym. I'm very methodical; I definitely think a lot of things way out in advance. Before I got my recent coach, I'd actually been training myself for the past five years. And people see one side of me on Instagram, but the other side that no one else can see, the hours of planning, research, and everything else that I have done to develop these plans and ideas that I have to see how they would work for me, and I've had a lot of success over the years with that. Of course, some mistakes, too, but it was all a great experience, it was all valuable data. Most of the time, to circle back to the question, it's decided in advance.  
  
**MC:** What are some injuries that you've dealt with?  
  
**AR:** Definitely hurt my back before. There was a time period in high school I actually had a bit of trouble walking. Putting anything on my back hurt like hell, and it was like that for several months. I definitely was hurting and at the same time that happened I got really sick that year. And with that, I had a lot of other stressors at that time. I was a senior in high school, I was getting ready to figure out what to do with my life. I think all those things compounded and exacerbated whatever I had going on and amplified the effects of whatever had happened. Whatever injury it was, I never really got it checked out. I just attempted to heal it over time. I also had a year where I had hip issues, particularly after the US Open, and it made squatting pretty difficult for a while. But lately, the past year and a half, two years, I have none. This is the time frame where I began to prioritize health. Fortunately, I've never had nerve damage, as far as I know. I've never broken any bones. Nothing significant like that. Within the past year, I've strained my pec twice. I've never torn it or anything like that, thankfully. And that's because I've really focused on health and nursing it back to health, so now it's pretty much at full health.  
  
**MC:** Can you think of some difficult decisions that you've made in training?  
  
**AR:** Deciding to move away from equipped lifting and focusing exclusively on raw lifting. Raw lifting was just getting so competitive. The talent pool is increasing every year; more and more people are coming out of the woodwork. And as that talent pool diversifies and grows further, I realized that I needed to put my stock into one or the other if I wanted to continue being not just a top contender, but to give myself the best chance possible to win. That's the goal, to win, at least for me. I decided at that point that I should start getting into raw lifting, because that's what I'm more passionate about. It's what I enjoy doing. And equipped lifting had its place in the past, but raw lifting is what I enjoy to do. It's not to say that I wasn't getting stronger in equipped lifting, because you are, but equipped lifting is a whole different beast. It's a lot more technically focused, and becoming adept at the gear and mastering it, and it's definitely different than raw lifting. It has its own dimension of challenges, and I think a lot of lifters would benefit from at least trying it, a couple of blocks or something. I know that not everyone has access to equipment, not everyone is able to do that, it's not realistic for everyone; that's why raw also has such a massive appeal, because you really don't need a whole lot to do raw lifting. The reality is, at bare minimum, you need nothing. You just need a singlet, socks, and a t-shirt. You don't have to have a belt or knee sleeves. All that stuff's optional. I think that's one of the big decisions I had to make, ultimately, deciding between raw lifting and equipped lifting.  
  
**MC:** What's an unforgettable experience you've had in training or competition, aside from winning the titles you've mentioned?  
  
**AR:** I will say one unforgettable experience in particular that I've had was earlier this year, actually. I was training at a friend's garage in Maryland. And I remember that day, I put up my first 2,100 training total. That day was massive for me because I had never done anything like that before. And I still had more in the tank after I did it. I was just absolutely shocked at how strong I had gotten over the quarantine period. That, to me, was a pivotal moment that really solidified in my mind that I had potential to be one of the best.  
  
**MC:** I think that was the first video I ever saw of you lifting. I remember thinking, ""Wow, holy shit!""  
  
**AR:** Yeah, it was good times!  
  
**MC:** So for a philosophical question, there's this concept I like to call the lifting space, which is essentially the role that training has played in your life. How big is that lifting space for you and how has it evolved with time?  
  
**AR:** I will definitely say, in my lifetime, I've had a lot of experiences, I've had a lot of ups and downs. At the end of the day, training and being able to do that, having the space to do what I love, is the one thing that I've always had no matter what. When things got hectic when I was younger, things happened, situations weren't always ideal, circumstances weren't always ideal, I could still train. I could still train for an hour or two, even if it was once, twice, three times a week, I could always do some sort of training. Training, for me, getting stronger, working towards my lifetime goals, was the glue that held a lot of things together for me over the years. And yeah, for a lot of people, it's just lifting weights, but for me, it's something I really have enjoyed doing and get pleasure out of doing. And I feel like I'm actually doing something, you know? No matter how big or small it is. To me, it's big. To me, it's played a huge role in my life. It's also taught me, even in the face of overwhelming odds, it's taught me persistence, extraordinary persistence, even in the face of difficult circumstances. It's taught me how to stick with something for a long period of time, to just consistently go at it over and over again. That has definitely carried over into what I do career-wise, what I do educationally. It's definitely a feature about me that has carried over into other aspects of my life, and I think it really started with training. I can attribute most of the success I have now to this extraordinary persistence. It's a difficult path, and it's what it takes.  
  
**MC:** Can you talk a little more about how it's carried over to other aspects of your life and how it manifests there?  
  
**AR:** That was really the main thing there, the extraordinary persistence. It's literally just the ability to stick with something nonstop and not give up, and by virtue of being in it for so long, over time, acquiring skills and acquiring technical mastery, and staying focused. That's an invaluable skill, trait, to have in other endeavors. If you can do that in everything you set out to do, you will reach some level of success in everything you set out to do. If you're focused, if you're persistent, if you don't give up...I think there are times that people are on a sinking ship and they don't realize that maybe they should cut ties with that particular thing, but if you really commit to something and you want something that will take you months, years, decades even, and you stick with it and stay focused, the sky's the limit. You can achieve a lot. And other people will admire you for your effort, and hopefully you'll motivate them.  
  
**MC:** Does lifting give your life meaning that can't be found anywhere else?  
  
**AR:** I'm not sure I've ever thought of it that way. A quick answer, a quick yes, mainly because there are goals that I have, specific strength goals that I can't do if I don't do the main primary movements like deadlift and squat. From a very early age I've set goals that I've wanted to hit, and I still haven't hit those goals yet, and I'm very much working towards it, and part of my life has been dedicated to achieving those goals, so I would say yes.  
  
**MC:** Has lifting taught you anything that you haven't mentioned yet about yourself? You've mentioned extraordinary persistence, any other character traits or attributes?  
  
**AR:** Focus. I think I've also learned a lot about how to manage pain and how to be strong in the face of difficulty, or when things are painful or when things are hard, how to keep pushing even though everything hurts or you have a lot of other things going on. That's definitely been a valuable asset that I've gotten from training.  
  
**MC:** Has it taught you anything about human nature or influenced your worldview?  
  
**AR:** I'll tell you one thing I've noticed, an observation. This isn't to bash people, but a lot of people don't like doing things for the long term. They like quick, easy results. They like things that come relatively easy. They're willing to some degree, but if you really want to recomp your body or gain more muscle mass or get stronger, it's going to take you years. That's a pretty intimidating and daunting thing for a lot of people, telling them that it's literally going to take them years. A lot of people don't necessarily think on the bandwidth of years, so when you approach them with that, it can be really intimidating. So I've noticed that while it's good to have long-term goals, if you are in it to win it for the long term and you're dedicated, if you are still unsure or you're new to it and you're just getting into things, I think setting a lot of short term goals along the way and working towards those for weeks and months, over time, and seeing how you can slowly adapt to the lifestyle of training and getting stronger and being fit. I've noticed that a lot of people are really intimidated by the long-term answer for training, getting stronger, and gaining muscle, because it does take years. There's really no way around that. It just takes a lot of hard work, persistence, effort, and focus. I know people aren't always willing to do that. People have a lot of other things going on in their lives. But if someone really wants something, when there's a will, there's a way. And that way may take a long time, but hey, some people are willing to pursue it relentlessly, and some people aren't.  
  
**MC:** What are some of your other hobbies and interests?  
  
**AR:** I really do enjoy studying human behavior, particularly psychology. I also like watching horror movies, like a lot. Like, A LOT A LOT. I used to like writing quite a bit. I'm thinking when I get older, I might dabble in it again, but things have been so hectic and busy that I haven't been able to write in graduate school, and I drifted a little bit away from that, mainly because I've put my focus and stock in other areas, but I might come back to it later. And I also enjoy reading scientific literature regarding fitness, and, of course, regarding psychology. Those are my main, primary interests.  
  
**MC:** Does lifting ever get in the way of those?  
  
**AR:** No. I won't say it ever gets in the way, but I will say that lifting and those things do affect each other to some degree. I have to prioritize time to each thing. We all have limited time. We all have a finite amount of time, and you allocate it to the things that matter to you. The amount of time you allocate to something is probably proportionate to how much you actually care about it. At different times, some things matter a little more. At different times, some things have to take the back seat. And that's OK. I won't say they necessarily get in the way of each other, but sometimes I'll allocate more time to one thing over another.  
  
**MC:** Can you imagine being done with training?  
  
**AR:** Not anytime soon!  
  
**MC:** Hopefully not, you're just getting started!  
  
**AR:** Yeah, that probably won't ever happen.  
  
**MC:** You see it being in your life forever in some way, shape, or form?  
  
**AR:** Yeah. I may not be competing forever, but I'll definitely be training forever as much as I physically can.  
  
**MC:** Final question. What would you like to tell beginner and intermediate lifters reading this?  
  
**AR:** Are we talking about straight up beginners or those that are committed to it already?  
  
**MC:** If you've got different things to say to both of those groups, then I would appreciate hearing them both.  
  
**AR:** I have some advice for those who are interested in competing and then for those who generally just want better fitness. To address those who are really interested in competing one day, and they're new to the sport, and they're starting to train, trying to find a coach and everything else, I would tell them, especially before that first meet, it's a big step. With that big step comes a lot of commitment and dedication to your training, and I would say don't get so overwhelmed. Don't worry so much about making weight, don't worry about having all the newest and nicest equipment and gear. Put up a total, go to the meet, have a good time, meet people. Lift within your means, prioritize your health, don't get injured, and leading up to that meet, stay dedicated and consistent in your training as much as you possibly can. And really just have a good time with it. If you like getting hyped during some of your training, get hyped during some of your training, especially if you're a younger lifter! You don't have to be boring, you don't have to lift like the best people lift. Just lift, be you, enjoy it, and enjoy the process. And over time, you'll grow anyway, if you stick with it. You might change, so don't freak out about everything, you won't have all the answers. You're in for a great ride. Relax, buckle up, and really enjoy what you're doing and the process.  
  
**MC:** How about for the people who are just seeking general fitness?  
  
**AR:** For those individuals, I will say do a little bit of your research. Look into the pros and cons of weight training, of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, look into what exactly what your goals are. Try to establish some concrete goals. They don't have to be long-term goals that take you years to achieve. They can be short-term goals. Let's say in two months, you want to lose five or ten pounds. Do some research on how you can do that. If you want to recomp your body, if you want to stay around the same body weight but have more muscle mass, look into ways it can be done. Try to make your goals as specific as possible, and concrete, and quantifiable and measurable. I'm going to stress this, reiterate this: have a good time as much as you can and enjoy the process as much as you can. Take pride in the progress you make along the way. Take pride in the baby steps in between those goals, and appropriately celebrate those baby steps that you've accomplished. You're certainly welcome to train alone, but it's also good to be around other individuals that are training who have similar goals. If you can, seek out a gym, become a member of a gym, and if not, you can gather your own equipment as well, but I would just caution you to do a lot of research and investigation before you get a bunch of things, have a whole setup, and still not know what you're doing at all. Try to find a sense of direction, try to establish concrete, quantifiable short-term goals, celebrate the baby steps along the way, and enjoy the process.  
  
**MC:** Anything else on your mind or anything that I didn't ask that you'd like to add?  
  
**AR:** I think I've said everything I wanted to say! Thanks for having me.  
  
**MC:** Thank you!  
  
  
  
This is an excerpt from my book, [Strength Speaks](https://leanpub.com/strength-speaks), which is a collection of fifteen interviews with high-level strength athletes, including several national and world champions in powerlifting, bodybuilding, and strongman. The interviews focus on how these champions acquired their physical and psychological skills as beginner and intermediate trainees, on how they use the lessons learned through training in everyday life, and on the philosophical and existential aspects present in lifting weights. Regardless of where you are in your training journey, there is something in here for you to take both into the gym and into your life.
Aside from Ashton Rouska, on the powerlifting side, [Strength Speaks](https://leanpub.com/strength-speaks) contains interviews with Emma Jarman, Meana Albsersworth, Scott Sullivan, and Gabriel Vega. All these lifters have Wilks scores above 500, and most hold top rankings in their respective weight classes. There is a wide variety of personalities, perspectives, and lessons in the interviews, and I hope that you find them valuable and useful regardless of where you are in training.  
  
Thank you!",powerlifting,"Interview with Ashton Rouska, the #2 all-time tested lifter in the world regardless of weight class. ## Ashton Rouska  
  
*At the time of this interview on October 24, 2020, Ashton Rouska held the #7 all-time ranking in powerlifting for drug-tested lifters across all weight classes with a 920 kg (2,028.2 lb) total at a bodyweight of 99.1 (218.4). Shortly after this interview, he rose to the #2 all-time ranking, totaling 950.5 kg (2,095.5 lb) at 98.4 (217), with a Dots score of 589.06.*  
  
**Michael Chernin:** How old are you and how long have you been training?  
  
**Ashton Rouska:** I'm twenty-three years old right now. I've been training since I was thirteen years old, and I've actually been powerlifting since I was sixteen years old.  
  
**MC:** How did you initially get into training?  
  
**AR:** During that time, I was getting into martial arts and sports and everything else, so I got into the weight room, and that's where I started actually lifting weights.  
  
**MC:** How did you get into powerlifting from that?  
  
**AR:** At the end of my sophmore year of high school, one of my wrestling coaches approached me and told me I should try a state powerlifting meet. Of course, then, I had no idea what it really all entailed. I had been watching videos of people lifting weights heavy and training videos at that point, anyway, so I thought, why not give it a good shot? I did the meet, feel in love with it, and have been competing since.  
  
**MC:** What are your most significant accomplishments? I know you just put together a monster total at a USAPL meet.  
  
**AR:** I would say, I remember when I won Open Raw Nationals in 2017. I was twenty years old in the 205 class. Also, back in '14, I won the IPF equipped Junior World Championship in the 183 pound weight class. I would say those two meets in particular and then the way that I won them stand out to me the most out of all the meets I've competed in.  
  
**MC:** How so?  
  
**AR:** I would also say 2019 Collegiate Nationals, my senior year of undergrad, when I won that meet in the 231 weight class weighing, I think, 206. I had a 1,930 total that day and just absolutely destroyed that day.  
  
**MC:** You recently destroyed the competition at your most recent meet as well, right?  
  
**AR:** Yeah, I was planning to train that day anyway and lift those weights. I heard there was a meet, and I thought I might as well make the two thousand-plus total official, so I went ahead and signed up for it about four days out.  
  
**MC:** Congratulations on getting that done!  
  
**AR:** Thank you! I got my next one three weeks from today.  
  
**MC:** When you were a beginner to lifting weights, powerlifting, how did you train?  
  
**AR:** I did a lot of hypertrophy, a lot of high volume, and I would lift to failure quite a bit. It's probably a miracle that I didn't get injured a lot more, but I pushed myself really, really hard those first couple years, day in and day out.  
  
**MC:** How did you first learn what you needed to? Did you have a coach or a lifting mentor, or are you self-taught?  
  
**AR:** That depends on the time period. Sometimes there were a couple coaches along the way. They weren't my actual coaches, but they were the coaches for the athletic teams I participated for, and I would do strength and conditioning training with some of the plans they would give me. I would modify some of the plans for myself, I would add or remove weights depending on how I felt, and I looked into a lot of different weight training methods. But, you know, being a thirteen or fourteen year old boy, I just wanted to hit it every day and get really big and strong.  
  
**MC:** How did you build your psychological skills for training to the level that you've gotten yourself to?  
  
**AR:** Well, the way that I saw it was at the end of the day my goal was, and still is, to be as strong as I possibly can, and every session, whether I feel good or bad, has meaning. It has value attached to that goal in some meaningful way. So every session is important. Every session matters. No matter how big or small. The bigger ones are funner, sure, but smaller ones still contribute to the ultimate goal. When it comes to breaking limits and barriers psychologically, I usually try not to get myself psyched up too much, but I definitely get into the zone, and I can get pretty intense at times. It's kind of like a switch that I have. I flip that switch, and once I do, I feel stronger. I feel much stronger.  
  
**MC:** Are you normally a pretty calm lifter, or do you need to get amped up for the big lifts that you do?  
  
**AR:** I would say that's evolved over time and it changes. Sometimes I'm very intense, very amped up. Sometimes, like now, I'm a bit more, I don't think ""calm"" is the right word, I think more so ""collected."" ""Composed"" is a better way to put it. I definitely still bring intensity, but I'm more composed now. Rather than just raw aggression, raw hype, it's much more channeled and focused now.  
  
**MC:** Yeah, people that start out as very emotional lifters usually become a lot more collected over time, from what I've seen.  
  
**AR:** Oh yeah, absolutely, and I think you'll see that a lot with the younger athletes anyway, just because they're young, they're getting into it, they're excited. It's totally normal. I'll say it's a shared experience.  
  
**MC:** What are some mistakes you've made throughout your training career or any regrets that you have?  
  
**AR:** Remember earlier how I said that every training session, no matter how big or small, contributes to the ultimate goal in some way? I don't regret any of my sessions. I don't regret any of the injuries that I've experienced, because they've all contributed to where I'm at now or where I'm going. I will say there are mistakes made along the way. Close to the beginning, when I was really excited, and I was just pushing and pushing and pushing, it got to the point where I got hurt pretty bad towards the end of high school. For three, four years after that, some of the areas that were hurt, I would definitely feel pain there while I was lifting. I was able to manage it pretty well and keep pushing, and once I hit the last year or so I began to prioritize things a little bit differently. The ultimate goal is to still get as strong as I possibly can, but I realized that in order to accomplish that, I have to be as healthy as possible. So I've really focused a lot on maintaining good health and prioritizing my health throughout all my training now. And it's evident with the things I've been able to do.  
  
**MC:** Has it gotten easier over time to prioritize the staying healthy versus going to the limit every session, or is that still challenging?  
  
**AR:** It's gotten a lot easier for me because, like I was explaining earlier, every session has a purpose, and you have to keep in mind what the purpose of that session is. If the purpose of that session is to get blood flow, just do some pump work, or if that session is to lift really heavy, to move weight that's really close to the max, that session should build it. Every session has its purpose, and I always try to keep that purpose in mind. When I do, I'm a lot more adept to navigating my training a lot better, and I see a lot of success.  
  
**MC:** Does the purpose of the session ever evolve during the session itself, or do you usually have the purpose decided before you even go to the gym?  
  
**AR:** Nine times out of ten, it's decided before I even go to the gym. I'm very methodical; I definitely think a lot of things way out in advance. Before I got my recent coach, I'd actually been training myself for the past five years. And people see one side of me on Instagram, but the other side that no one else can see, the hours of planning, research, and everything else that I have done to develop these plans and ideas that I have to see how they would work for me, and I've had a lot of success over the years with that. Of course, some mistakes, too, but it was all a great experience, it was all valuable data. Most of the time, to circle back to the question, it's decided in advance.  
  
**MC:** What are some injuries that you've dealt with?  
  
**AR:** Definitely hurt my back before. There was a time period in high school I actually had a bit of trouble walking. Putting anything on my back hurt like hell, and it was like that for several months. I definitely was hurting and at the same time that happened I got really sick that year. And with that, I had a lot of other stressors at that time. I was a senior in high school, I was getting ready to figure out what to do with my life. I think all those things compounded and exacerbated whatever I had going on and amplified the effects of whatever had happened. Whatever injury it was, I never really got it checked out. I just attempted to heal it over time. I also had a year where I had hip issues, particularly after the US Open, and it made squatting pretty difficult for a while. But lately, the past year and a half, two years, I have none. This is the time frame where I began to prioritize health. Fortunately, I've never had nerve damage, as far as I know. I've never broken any bones. Nothing significant like that. Within the past year, I've strained my pec twice. I've never torn it or anything like that, thankfully. And that's because I've really focused on health and nursing it back to health, so now it's pretty much at full health.  
  
**MC:** Can you think of some difficult decisions that you've made in training?  
  
**AR:** Deciding to move away from equipped lifting and focusing exclusively on raw lifting. Raw lifting was just getting so competitive. The talent pool is increasing every year; more and more people are coming out of the woodwork. And as that talent pool diversifies and grows further, I realized that I needed to put my stock into one or the other if I wanted to continue being not just a top contender, but to give myself the best chance possible to win. That's the goal, to win, at least for me. I decided at that point that I should start getting into raw lifting, because that's what I'm more passionate about. It's what I enjoy doing. And equipped lifting had its place in the past, but raw lifting is what I enjoy to do. It's not to say that I wasn't getting stronger in equipped lifting, because you are, but equipped lifting is a whole different beast. It's a lot more technically focused, and becoming adept at the gear and mastering it, and it's definitely different than raw lifting. It has its own dimension of challenges, and I think a lot of lifters would benefit from at least trying it, a couple of blocks or something. I know that not everyone has access to equipment, not everyone is able to do that, it's not realistic for everyone; that's why raw also has such a massive appeal, because you really don't need a whole lot to do raw lifting. The reality is, at bare minimum, you need nothing. You just need a singlet, socks, and a t-shirt. You don't have to have a belt or knee sleeves. All that stuff's optional. I think that's one of the big decisions I had to make, ultimately, deciding between raw lifting and equipped lifting.

And yeah, for a lot of people, it's just lifting weights, but for me, it's something I really have enjoyed doing and get pleasure out of doing. And I feel like I'm actually doing something, you know?

It's taught me how to stick with something for a long period of time, to just consistently go at it over and over again. That has definitely carried over into what I do career-wise, what I do educationally. It's definitely a feature about me that has carried over into other aspects of my life, and I think it really started with training. I can attribute most of the success I have now to this extraordinary persistence. It's a difficult path, and it's what it takes.  
  
**MC:** Can you talk a little more about how it's carried over to other aspects of your life and how it manifests there?  
  
**AR:** That was really the main thing there, the extraordinary persistence. It's literally just the ability to stick with something nonstop and not give up, and by virtue of being in it for so long, over time, acquiring skills and acquiring technical mastery, and staying focused. That's an invaluable skill, trait, to have in other endeavors. If you can do that in everything you set out to do, you will reach some level of success in everything you set out to do. If you're focused, if you're persistent, if you don't give up...I think there are times that people are on a sinking ship and they don't realize that maybe they should cut ties with that particular thing, but if you really commit to something and you want something that will take you months, years, decades even, and you stick with it and stay focused, the sky's the limit.

That's definitely been a valuable asset that I've gotten from training.  
  
**MC:** Has it taught you anything about human nature or influenced your worldview?  
  
**AR:** I'll tell you one thing I've noticed, an observation. This isn't to bash people, but a lot of people don't like doing things for the long term. They like quick, easy results. They like things that come relatively easy. They're willing to some degree, but if you really want to recomp your body or gain more muscle mass or get stronger, it's going to take you years. That's a pretty intimidating and daunting thing for a lot of people, telling them that it's literally going to take them years. A lot of people don't necessarily think on the bandwidth of years, so when you approach them with that, it can be really intimidating. So I've noticed that while it's good to have long-term goals, if you are in it to win it for the long term and you're dedicated, if you are still unsure or you're new to it and you're just getting into things, I think setting a lot of short term goals along the way and working towards those for weeks and months, over time, and seeing how you can slowly adapt to the lifestyle of training and getting stronger and being fit. I've noticed that a lot of people are really intimidated by the long-term answer for training, getting stronger, and gaining muscle, because it does take years. There's really no way around that. It just takes a lot of hard work, persistence, effort, and focus. I know people aren't always willing to do that. People have a lot of other things going on in their lives. But if someone really wants something, when there's a will, there's a way. And that way may take a long time, but hey, some people are willing to pursue it relentlessly, and some people aren't.  
  
**MC:** What are some of your other hobbies and interests?  
  
**AR:** I really do enjoy studying human behavior, particularly psychology. I also like watching horror movies, like a lot. Like, A LOT A LOT. I used to like writing quite a bit. I'm thinking when I get older, I might dabble in it again, but things have been so hectic and busy that I haven't been able to write in graduate school, and I drifted a little bit away from that, mainly because I've put my focus and stock in other areas, but I might come back to it later. And I also enjoy reading scientific literature regarding fitness, and, of course, regarding psychology. Those are my main, primary interests.  
  
**MC:** Does lifting ever get in the way of those?  
  
**AR:** No. I won't say it ever gets in the way, but I will say that lifting and those things do affect each other to some degree. I have to prioritize time to each thing. We all have limited time. We all have a finite amount of time, and you allocate it to the things that matter to you. The amount of time you allocate to something is probably proportionate to how much you actually care about it. At different times, some things matter a little more. At different times, some things have to take the back seat. And that's OK. I won't say they necessarily get in the way of each other, but sometimes I'll allocate more time to one thing over another.  
  
**MC:** Can you imagine being done with training?  
  
**AR:** Not anytime soon!  
  
**MC:** Hopefully not, you're just getting started!  
  
**AR:** Yeah, that probably won't ever happen.  
  
**MC:** You see it being in your life forever in some way, shape, or form?  
  
**AR:** Yeah. I may not be competing forever, but I'll definitely be training forever as much as I physically can.  
  
**MC:** Final question. What would you like to tell beginner and intermediate lifters reading this?  
  
**AR:** Are we talking about straight up beginners or those that are committed to it already?  
  
**MC:** If you've got different things to say to both of those groups, then I would appreciate hearing them both.  
  
**AR:** I have some advice for those who are interested in competing and then for those who generally just want better fitness. To address those who are really interested in competing one day, and they're new to the sport, and they're starting to train, trying to find a coach and everything else, I would tell them, especially before that first meet, it's a big step. With that big step comes a lot of commitment and dedication to your training, and I would say don't get so overwhelmed. Don't worry so much about making weight, don't worry about having all the newest and nicest equipment and gear. Put up a total, go to the meet, have a good time, meet people. Lift within your means, prioritize your health, don't get injured, and leading up to that meet, stay dedicated and consistent in your training as much as you possibly can. And really just have a good time with it. If you like getting hyped during some of your training, get hyped during some of your training, especially if you're a younger lifter! You don't have to be boring, you don't have to lift like the best people lift. Just lift, be you, enjoy it, and enjoy the process. And over time, you'll grow anyway, if you stick with it. You might change, so don't freak out about everything, you won't have all the answers. You're in for a great ride. Relax, buckle up, and really enjoy what you're doing and the process.  
  
**MC:** How about for the people who are just seeking general fitness?  
  
**AR:** For those individuals, I will say do a little bit of your research. Look into the pros and cons of weight training, of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, look into what exactly what your goals are. Try to establish some concrete goals. They don't have to be long-term goals that take you years to achieve. They can be short-term goals. Let's say in two months, you want to lose five or ten pounds. Do some research on how you can do that. If you want to recomp your body, if you want to stay around the same body weight but have more muscle mass, look into ways it can be done. Try to make your goals as specific as possible, and concrete, and quantifiable and measurable. I'm going to stress this, reiterate this: have a good time as much as you can and enjoy the process as much as you can. Take pride in the progress you make along the way. Take pride in the baby steps in between those goals, and appropriately celebrate those baby steps that you've accomplished. You're certainly welcome to train alone, but it's also good to be around other individuals that are training who have similar goals. If you can, seek out a gym, become a member of a gym, and if not, you can gather your own equipment as well, but I would just caution you to do a lot of research and investigation before you get a bunch of things, have a whole setup, and still not know what you're doing at all. Try to find a sense of direction, try to establish concrete, quantifiable short-term goals, celebrate the baby steps along the way, and enjoy the process.  
  
**MC:** Anything else on your mind or anything that I didn't ask that you'd like to add?  
  
**AR:** I think I've said everything I wanted to say! Thanks for having me.  
  
**MC:** Thank you!  
  
  
  
This is an excerpt from my book, [Strength Speaks](https://leanpub.com/strength-speaks), which is a collection of fifteen interviews with high-level strength athletes, including several national and world champions in powerlifting, bodybuilding, and strongman. The interviews focus on how these champions acquired their physical and psychological skills as beginner and intermediate trainees, on how they use the lessons learned through training in everyday life, and on the philosophical and existential aspects present in lifting weights. Regardless of where you are in your training journey, there is something in here for you to take both into the gym and into your life.
Aside from Ashton Rouska, on the powerlifting side, [Strength Speaks](https://leanpub.com/strength-speaks) contains interviews with Emma Jarman, Meana Albsersworth, Scott Sullivan, and Gabriel Vega. All these lifters have Wilks scores above 500, and most hold top rankings in their respective weight classes. There is a wide variety of personalities, perspectives, and lessons in the interviews, and I hope that you find them valuable and useful regardless of where you are in training.  
  
Thank you!"

aiq67e,1548183852.0,How to hire a coach,"I very recently was looking for a coach and didn't know how to start. There are a ton of coaches out there at various levels, and probably more qualified coaches that don't even advertise on social media. Given all that, I needed a way to really dig into the practices and coaching strategies of the people I spoke to. I came up with a short list of questions that really helped me finalize my choice. Hopefully this post becomes a growing list in the comments to help new people find qualified coaching.

- *Who have they coached like you?*

This is probably the first question you should ask and weight the heaviest. If you want to get better, a coach should ideally have a track record of working with athletes at your current level and making them better. You can use Wilks as a proxy, or just goals, e.g. if you've qualified for USAPL Raw Nationals repeatedly but never for the Arnold, ask them about that. Dig into what challenges those athletes faced and how the coach responded. Volume tolerance, injuries, whatever you think is holding you back.

- *Who have they coached at the level above you?*

Similar to above, but trying to understand if the coach has a successful track record of growing athletes longer than your current level. If the answer is ""nobody"", that's not necessarily a bad thing. You just need to be patient as the coach learns alongside you. 

- *Who / what are their major influences?*

You may have your own biases, and buy-in is really important. If you're pro-Westside and the coach you're speaking to doesn't believe much in max effort work, you need to be okay with trusting them. If you have the phrase ""submax DUP"" tattooed on your arm but this coach tends to program high RPE work regularly, you'll have to really do your best to follow the program regardless of your bias, and only after a test phase (like a meet) would you reconvene to discuss what went well or poorly. 

- *How do they handle athlete communication?*

Figure out how much communication fits your personality. I know coaches that give their numbers or open their DMs and field questions throughout the day. Some coaches prefer just weekly email check ins, or video chats. If you consider yourself high-touch, don't hire a coach that doesn't respond to emails in 24 hours.

- *How do they handle coaching outside of programming?*

Movement prep, warm up drills, rooting and bracing mechanics, mental game - just a few of the things that'll pop up over the course of working with a coach for a few years. If you know where you suck now, ask how they've worked on those issues with other athletes. If you're prone to tendinitis, ask if they've helped athletes progress and manage pain. If you have a hip shift, ask about their experiences with coaching through that. 

- *How do they handle meet day handling?*

Meets are hard. Some coaches have pre existing relationships and can help you find local handlers, or field a team at a big enough meet. Some coaches send you a spreadsheet and have you follow the program. Others field texts on meet day. Figure out how much you think you need and ask questions.

There are lower weight questions you may still value (do they still lift? Do they coach full time?) so make sure you write out anything you care about, and understand what's non-negotiable for you.

Of course you can check out the last thread but to throw some names out there -  Derek Kendall, Pozdeev, Belyaev, Malanichev, Vince Urbank, Kade Weber, Jamie Lewis, George Leeman, Eric Spoto, Jeremy Hamilton and many more.

Also, partly why I thought to re-do this thread, RIP Chris Hickson who passed away recently.

I'll kick off - at one time Derek Kendall was an absolute monster and then he just sort of disappeared. Dude was squatting like 900, front squatting 800, pulling 8-900.

Just over a year ago I posted the [2018 /r/powerlifting census](https://old.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/9kx9ly/2018_rpowerlifting_census_results/).  I'd like to repeat this for 2019.

Anyway here are the surveys:

#[English units survey link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsxT9T84B4Fw7TXG3VQFhLRQq5aHIv4bLPS0nOJ13ly9FlPw/viewform?usp=sf_link) (Pounds and inches)

Changes from last year's survey:

- Divided into two sections.  The first section is lifting-related, while the second section is a demographics/personal info section.  **The second section is completely optional.**

- Added response options for people that compete equipped

- Changed some questions to short answer from multiple choice

- Removed ""other"" option from certain questions which got way too wide a variety of responses last year.

- Added questions relating to footwear, deadlift stance, deadlift grip, and coaching.

- Removed questions that didn't seem to get meaningful responses or too wide of a variety of responses to analyze.

I plan to keep this survey open until next Sunday.  After that I'll start analyzing and publish the results in an album along with the raw .csv data for anyone that cares.

I hope this gets as good of a response as last year.  Thanks for participating.

P.S. If you responded to my preliminary survey posted to the daily discussion last night and choose to respond again, let me know in the last question of the survey so I can remove your old duplicate response.",powerlifting,"/r/powerlifting Census 2019 Hi all,

zaj1ee,1669979197.0,Why do most gyms not have enough equipment for barbell movements?,"My current gym has been extended. They added more machines. They already had lots of machines for all muscle groups. There are at least 4 chest machines on top of all the cable machines that you could use to do chest, 3 abs machine on top of ab benches and pilates mats. The have 3 leg press and bough a hack squat machine, which they put in the middle of everything.

On the other hand, there is 1 power rack, 1 squat rack, 2 benchpress benches(which have no safeties either) and no good place to deadlift. There is some space in front of the squat rack, but it's almost always full. If you are lucky you might find some space to deadlift in the space they added, somewhere between those machines. Of course disk storage options are at least 5 m away and you would have to carry the disks for more than 10 m in most cases. Do I have to mention they don't have enough barbells and not a single tool to help rack and u rack the bar for deadlifts? Also, when you carry those disks you need to walk through a crowd of people, just for extra danger.

A single machine can cost anywhere from 3k to 10k. You can get a new power/squat rack for 1k from Rogue. A barbell is less than 1k, that tool that helps you rack/unrack the bar is even cheaper. Price is certainly not the problem. Space isn't either as you can use a power rack for a lot more exercises than an ab machine. Customer demand is not a problem either. The power and bench racks are almost always full at the peak hours, I can't say the same for that abductor machine they got that probably costed thousands. I can't find a single logical argument for their decision. I have been to gyms that had more squat racks and even those are all occupied at peak hours. There is certainly a high demand from customers for barbell and dumbbell equipment as it's a lot easier to share a chest machine vs a squat rack. 

I'd go to a powerlifting gym if there was one in my area, but sadly there isn't.

This report is about my friend, Leon. He is 70-years-old and blind. Last year, I was talking to him casually in the country club-style gym we both attend. When I mentioned I was training for powerlifting, he became interested. He has a son out-of-state who does bench press-only competitions. He lamented that he couldn’t lift weights like he wanted because he couldn’t safely find his way around the weight room. I said something like, “Well, you’re always here when I’m training. I’ll meet you at the bench press tomorrow.”

He worked on bench press, and within a few months, I talked him into deadlifting, but he did *not* want to try to squat. However, once he was comfortable deadlifting, he was willing to give squats a try. Quickly, his attitude changed from “squats are too dangerous for me” to “how much is the minimum I can squat in a competition and not be embarrassed”, and then to “if I can squat above my own body weight, I am willing to try a full power meet.”

In the weeks leading up to the meet, we discussed what he wanted his priority to be: lift PRs or a total. Leon was decisive that he wanted to total over 700lbs (317.5kg). So I planned his attempts with the objective of making the best possible total. 

**Training & Preparation**

It is difficult for Leon to follow a traditional program without his vision, and we aren’t together for every training session. I have taught him the big 3 and some of the variations and accessories he can do on his own. When we train together, our primary focus is on developing a consistent, repetitious technique that works for him.  As far as programming and progression is concerned, I give him basic “rules of thumb” to follow. For example, “In the next four weeks, we are working on volume. I want you to focus on sets of 6-8 with a challenging weight. If you can do 8, add a little more weight and keep going. When you can’t do 6, you’re done.”

**Competition Time**

Leon was very nervous about weigh-ins and making the 82.5kg class. He didn’t eat or drink much the night before and came in a 78.9kg even though he walks around at about 83kg. After he weighed in, we went to a buffet and demolished a few plates of food. He was back to 82kg on the next day. 

*Squat*

* [1st attempt – 87.5kg / 192lbs](https://youtu.be/waPQ_hvd4cE) - GOOD LIFT - Leon has done 85kg for sets of 3 in training. That’s what we wanted for a minimum opening lift. Warm-ups went well, so we chose the higher of the two openers we had planned. He sailed through and I expected we could hit a big PR today. 

* [2nd attempt – 92.5kg / 203lbs](https://youtu.be/8utyyQXt3Ic) - NO LIFT - Missed the lights in the video, but the two side refs red-lighted this one on depth. It shook Leon’s confidence a little bit because he has been very good with depth in training. I watched the recording back and assured him that he was still moving the weight quickly and I was confident he would nail his 3rd. 

* [3rd attempt - 95kg / 209lbs](https://youtu.be/OutYx1WOItc) - GOOD LIFT – His best squat in training was 210lbs. We left some kilos behind on this day, but this lift built Leon’s confidence immensely and put more on his total.  

*Bench Press*

* [1st attempt – 97.5kg / 214lbs](https://youtu.be/gWz3I83myKk) - GOOD LIFT – Bench press is, by far, Leon’s favorite lift and it shows. His opener qualifies him as “Elite” on the USPA classification chart. (And he *is* benching more than he squats…)

* [2nd attempt – 102.5kg / 225lbs](https://youtu.be/mXTuO8mgjuY) - GOOD LIFT – Sticking to the plan, we were going to base the third attempt on how well he could move 225lbs, a weight he used a lot in training. Leon loves to put 2 plates on and repeatedly lift singles. He would do that every day if I didn’t persuade him into more varied training.  

* [3rd attempt – 107.5kg / 237lbs](https://youtu.be/DBFXEncw6ZU) - GOOD LIFT – I asked Leon, “Do you want to go for a little PR or a big PR?” He hesitated, so I reminded him that we weren’t over 700lbs yet. He decided to try for a small PR, I gave this weight to the scoring table, and it was just right. He would not have finished 110kg this day. 


*Deadlift*

* [1st attempt – 112.5kg / 248lbs](https://youtu.be/OlRv0A21X2A) - GOOD LIFT – Nice and fast, another weight he has tripled in training. 

* [2nd attempt - 120kg / 265lbs](https://youtu.be/pj6SgHgg4xU) - GOOD LIFT – Before he went out for this lift, I reminded Leon that he would need to tell me how much he had left for the third attempt. Our minimum increase would put him equal to his best training PR, 122.5kg. He was hoping to reach 125kg when we laid out the plan. 

When he came off the platform, he was energized and said, “let’s go for it!” So…

* [3rd attempt – 127.5kg / 281lbs](https://youtu.be/VE7wm8gdyXA) - GOOD LIFT – A pretty nice pull. Maybe he could have done a bit more, too. As we walked off the platform, I told him he just lifted 281lbs. “What!? I thought we were going to do 275!” 

“No way, buddy. You already earned a 700lb total, and I knew you had it in you.” 

**Conclusion**

In the end, Leon claimed the 4 empty state records and set 3 American records (all but the squat) in the USPA drug-tested division. He made a lot of new friends and received a hearty, warm welcome to the powerlifting community. This week, he is enjoying retelling his story and showing his medal to anyone who is interested at the athletic club. He has also decided to keep training hard and return to the platform to do even better.

I watched the recording back and assured him that he was still moving the weight quickly and I was confident he would nail his 3rd. 

* [3rd attempt - 95kg / 209lbs](https://youtu.be/OutYx1WOItc) - GOOD LIFT – His best squat in training was 210lbs. We left some kilos behind on this day, but this lift built Leon’s confidence immensely and put more on his total.  

*Bench Press*

* [1st attempt – 97.5kg / 214lbs](https://youtu.be/gWz3I83myKk) - GOOD LIFT – Bench press is, by far, Leon’s favorite lift and it shows. His opener qualifies him as “Elite” on the USPA classification chart. (And he *is* benching more than he squats…)

* [2nd attempt – 102.5kg / 225lbs](https://youtu.be/mXTuO8mgjuY) - GOOD LIFT – Sticking to the plan, we were going to base the third attempt on how well he could move 225lbs, a weight he used a lot in training. Leon loves to put 2 plates on and repeatedly lift singles. He would do that every day if I didn’t persuade him into more varied training.  

* [3rd attempt – 107.5kg / 237lbs](https://youtu.be/DBFXEncw6ZU) - GOOD LIFT – I asked Leon, “Do you want to go for a little PR or a big PR?” He hesitated, so I reminded him that we weren’t over 700lbs yet. He decided to try for a small PR, I gave this weight to the scoring table, and it was just right. He would not have finished 110kg this day. 


*Deadlift*

* [1st attempt – 112.5kg / 248lbs](https://youtu.be/OlRv0A21X2A) - GOOD LIFT – Nice and fast, another weight he has tripled in training. 

* [2nd attempt - 120kg / 265lbs](https://youtu.be/pj6SgHgg4xU) - GOOD LIFT – Before he went out for this lift, I reminded Leon that he would need to tell me how much he had left for the third attempt. Our minimum increase would put him equal to his best training PR, 122.5kg. He was hoping to reach 125kg when we laid out the plan. 

When he came off the platform, he was energized and said, “let’s go for it!” So…

* [3rd attempt – 127.5kg / 281lbs](https://youtu.be/VE7wm8gdyXA) - GOOD LIFT – A pretty nice pull. Maybe he could have done a bit more, too. As we walked off the platform, I told him he just lifted 281lbs. “What!? I thought we were going to do 275!” 

“No way, buddy. You already earned a 700lb total, and I knew you had it in you.” 

**Conclusion**

In the end, Leon claimed the 4 empty state records and set 3 American records (all but the squat) in the USPA drug-tested division. He made a lot of new friends and received a hearty, warm welcome to the powerlifting community. This week, he is enjoying retelling his story and showing his medal to anyone who is interested at the athletic club. He has also decided to keep training hard and return to the platform to do even better.

5mnpa2,1483832960.0,One-arm Dewd Getting It Back.,"Good afternoon all. I've posted in here before and have had a post about me in here before too, I believe it was this one. 

Either way, my last meet was Dec. 2014 where I totaled 1019 or around there. 


My lifts were: 
Squat: 242.5kg (534lbs) 
Bench: 65kg (142lbs)
Deadlift: 155kg (341lbs)

Body weight of: 154kg (340lbs) 

[SPP: Powerlifting Meet](https://youtu.be/k17-9kfYmWY)

I hurt my back (pulled muscles) on my second squat. I iced it down quickly after and processed to hit my third squat at 242. After each lift after that, I would ice my back. 

Thankfully, it wasn't too bad as I did finish the meet and destroyed my goal to break 453kg (1000lbs) total. After the meet I took several weeks off from lifting. Hoping that whatever I did to my back would be healed up and I could start training for another meet. 

I then went back into the gym and went really light to get back into it. A few weeks in, I was up to about 142kg (315lbs) and the part of my back that hurt at the meet started hurting again. After that, I got scared to squat anymore and became depressed. So I quit going to the gym.

Fast forward to August or September 2015, I was motivated enough to get back into the gym. I lost a lot of strength and gained a lot of weight (fat) back. It sucked, but I knew that I'd eventually get it back and train to kill my last total. 

Come October 28th, 2015, I was bench pressing and felt freaking awesome. I had only been working out in the 50-60% range of my training max (of 2014 meet).  Feeling good, I decided to go a little heavier, then a little heavier. Well, I was at 61kg (135lbs) and started the lift. Came down with ease and a bit of a struggle coming back up. No problem, I kept pushing. Just a little bit before kick out, I heard/felt a RIP!! 

The bar came back down and falling towArd my neck/face. Thankfully, my awesome spotter caught it for me. I literally could only hang on to it. No pushing power at all. It hurt, but didn't hurt. Kinda like getting a ""frog"" on your quad.  

Shit, I'm done. It's over and I'm just dead. 

Well, I went to see my shoulder doctor and a MRI confirmed a complete tear of my sub scapular. Damn it! 

Like and idiot maybe, I continued to go to the gym and did the workouts I could do.  Curls and tricep work was fine, but nothing else for the arm. 

Surgery date set for December 28, 2015. Yes, two months later to the date. 

Surgery went well, minus before surgery, the techs and doctor blew out 4 veins in my right foot, before they were finally able to get an IV in. Not sure how long I was in the operating room,  it I woke up high as hell, my wife next to me, and a nurse giving me home made cookies that she cooked. 

The entire month of January I did absolutely nothing. Popped pain meds for the first 5 days or so and after that, only took aspirin and the like for pain management. This recovery period was straight up hell. My doctor said not to do anything at all to move my shoulder. 

I was a ""special"" case as I only had one-arm and the fact that my sub scapular retracted so much, that any wrong movement or jar to it could tear it again. So off work for what was suppose to be 4 weeks, but 3.5 weeks in, I couldn't stand it. 

The worst part was, I had to wipe my own ass. My wife told me before that she wouldn't wipe my ass if I ever hurt my arm/shoulder to the point I needed help. So, to tell you that wiping my ass for two moths myself, damn near, if not more, hurt worse than what the surgery did. 

I still love her mean ass. 

I went to PT for the entire month of February. Three days a week for the 4 week time. After my 4 weeks was up, my doctor ""looked"" me over and said I was progressing far better than he expected and far better than any of his other rotator cuff patients. 

During PT, if he said do 10 reps of this, I did 15. Anything he had me do, I did more. The doctor suggested that I do another month of PT, but he stated that he knew I didn't want to. Even the PT tech stated he would only have me doing the same things again and it wouldn't really help 

So opted out of more PT. It was way too expensive anyways. 

Come mid March 2016, I was back in the gym doing everything I did in PT. The hardest thing at that time was to ""bench press"" a 5lbs dumbbell. Mentally I was so screwed and nervous that I started out with one rep each day for a few weeks. Eventually I worked up to 2kg (5lbs) for reps of 10. So I progressed pretty well, but I was still nervous and scared to go up.

A few times my shoulder would pop and I'd have a flash back from when I heard/felt the tear. The PT said pop sounds will most likely happen fir now on. Great!  Not! 

Fast forward toward to the mid-ish 2016 and I'm comfortably benching 31kg (70lbs) dumbbells for 3 sets of 10 reps. A lot of time and mental effort has been put in to get this far. 

As for my deadlift, it's pretty much gone. It never hurt to do it, I just lost most of my hand strength. I did and am still able to get 102kg (225lbs) for one with out a strap. 

Back to my squats. I did get back up to 183kg (405lbs) fir two reps, but after that, I tweaked my back again. Damn it. Another set back. 

I took a week or so off and once it started feeling better, I started squatting again. A bunch of volume. Starting with the bar and doing several sets with a ton of reps with it alone. Then warming up with adding  weight slowly. 

This one of the hardest things I had to do. Going from 242.5kg (534lbs) to nearly nothing really hurt my ego, but I know the ego didn't need to be in the gym.  

So now, I'm up to my new max reps of 156kgX5 (345lbs) at 143kg (316lbs). Mostly the reason I wanted to do this post. It's taking a lot of time and a lot of patience to get here. I am proud of myself, but by no means bragging.  

I doubt I'll be doing any more powerlifting meets, but I am starting to train others for meets. I'm also working on becoming a motivation and inspirational speaker. These two things are what I really want to do in life, minus continue hitting the gym. 

So I guess that's it for now. I've typed this up in my phone non-stop, so if I bounce around or make no sense, that's why. I'll post my 156kg (345lbs) squat in a post after submitting this.

I've benched 515@242 and 530@270 in full power meets. Since those meets I've paused 545 in the gym and have a tng bench of 565. I've been unable to compete in full power for the last year due to some knee issues. They are being worked on and hopefully I'll be able to return. I've done all my own programming over the years and have learned a thing or two about lifting. When I was unable to compete I shifted my focus to programming, I've done pretty well so far, I've taken a few lifters from the 700's into the 800's on their squat. On bench the biggest I've had a hand in was a 573 bench at 275lbs.

Here are a few videos of some me lifting

and other lifters I've programmed

With the Arnold coming up this weekend I have a number of lifters completing their programs. This leaves me with some space to take on a few new guys. I'm going to take on 10 of you guys again and help build your bench, totally free no strings attached. Last time I did this it was hugely successful, pretty much everyone finished up with a nice pr of on average 20-30lbs. I'm sure there are people here that can attest to that.

So the basics. It's a 2 day program without anything very complicated. As long as you have a bench press and dumbbells you should have all you need to make it work, with the exception of a slingshot for a few days. Each bench session will run you on average of 2-2.5hrs long. I'll want you to be able to take videos so I can see how things are going on the heavy day. I'll also need you to stick with it. It's not an easy program, but getting stronger in general takes some hard work.

What I'll need from you to start is your current max. That means actually current, not what you benched 6 months ago and haven't touched since. I'd also like you to lay out your training week for me so I can make sure the days fall inline with your other training. The rest we can discuss more in depth through email.

So if you want to give it a shot email me at mdisbrow85@gmail.com with some basic info about yourself. I've also got room for a few full power programs. Unfortunately those take far more of my time and I can't do them for free, but if you'd like help with all three let me know and we can talk more.

I'm heading to train at 6pm EST. If I don see your email before then or am unable to reply I will be sure to this evening when I get back home.

Edit: Alright guys I'm grabbing a bite to eat before heading to the gym. I've answered some of the emails and will get to the others when I return. I have not selected all 10 lifters yet so don't feel like you've misses a chance. 

Edit 2: Back from training and starting to get through emails. I'll do my best to get to most of them tonight. I've got at least 50 while I was in the gym and had another 10-15 unanswered from before I left.

Edit 3: Alright guys I've emailed the 10 I'll be working with. If I didn't pick you I promise it has nothing to do with your current strength level. I do still have room for people looking for coaching, email me if you are still interested. I'm done for tonight though.

I lead the powerlifting team at my college, and we are putting on our first-ever competition later this semester. My team and I have been considering some details of the competition and are running into one issue of concern, which is how to navigate competitions with transgender lifters. I absolutely love that sports like powerlifting are pretty accessible to all genders identities, but the strength differences between the sexes poses a clear issue in certain respects.

I understand that this is a very complex and loaded topic, and I would never want to invalidate someone's identity. With that being said, we are struggling to decide how the sex divisions might look in this competition, where trans lifters are involved. For someone who is FTM, it's pretty cut and dry-- the athlete is a man, likely using testosterone, and would be able to compete in the male category without any unfair advantages. However, our issue comes with MTF athletes. With these lifters competing against other women, their biology would obviously give them a significant advantage in competition. However, it would also be completely bigoted and a blatant insult to their identity to force these women to compete in the men's category.

How should we handle this? We are feeling pretty stumped and I would appreciate any advice.

Edit— no need to downvote me for wanting to see some different thoughts on a complex situation with no right answer. Yes I have talked to some of the trans lifters in the group. Yes this is a real situation. Yes, I am aware of some of the solutions to this, and yes, I did my own research about how different federations handle this before I posted. (No, this post is not an excuse for you to be transphobic!)

I've been lifting consistently for just over 3 years now, although for the majority of the time my focus was on weightloss/looks. I've been training for strength since March following Sheiko's Advanced Small Load Program specifically for this meet.


My numbers at the start of this training program were 295/190/325. Once I started training I made an effort to eating more which helped me hit training PR's of 335/240/395.


So I was definitely hit by a bunch of nerves the night before the meet, not to mention the fact that I forgot my singlet at home and had to compete in a borrowed one. (Shout-out to Grover from Iron Works Gym for being an amazing individual)


I completed all 3 squat attempts which helped to stifle my remaining anxiety. But then I failed my first bench because I ignored all cues, failed my second because I used a too narrow grip and couldn't lockout and ended up having only one successful attempt that was about 10lbs lighter than I had been planning. 


I went into this meet aiming for a 1000lb total so I had to aim higher on my deadlift if I was still going to achieve that. Fortunately, all my deadlift attempts were successful and I finished the comp with a 1011lb total.


Overall, it was a fun experience and I am definitely looking forward to getting stronger for the next.",powerlifting,"[Meet Report] First Powerlifting Meet, Finally in the 1000lb club! Stats: Male/6'0""/230lb

bl54rk,1557102058.0,[FILM REVIEW] Westside vs The World,"Hey folks, first, full disclosure: I wrote the below review primarily for a non-powerlifting familiar audience.  If it feels condescending, please don't interpret it that way.  

I backed the kickstarted for the movie “Westside Vs the World” and, as a result I got an advanced digital download.  For those completely unaware, this was an independent film chronicling the history of the Westside Barbell powerlifting club.  Also for those unaware, the release of this film was mired in as much drama as anything powerlifting related could be, to include having its release date pushed back indefinitely after one of the developers of the film split from the production crew, stole all the kickstarter funds, used the money to buy drugs with intent to sell before getting arrested, resulting in the original film creator having to sue that individual to get back the kickstarter funds along with screenings of the film held in gyms all over the country in order to help replenish lost funds.  A good amount of us backing the film had pretty much resigned ourselves to the fact that we’d never actually get our copies, and many disparaging things were said about the film and its creators.  I myself equated it to the “Duke Nuke ‘em Forever” of powerlifting.  But then, finally, the day had arrived and I got my early release digital copy of the film.  I have sense watched it, and wanted to share an advanced screening review with you to help you decide if it’s something worth spending your $10 on (if you pre-order).



**WHAT IS THE FILM ABOUT?**



The actual “Westside vs The World” film is about the history of the Westside Barbell Powerlifting Club, which, in turn, means it’s primarily a story about Louie Simmons, as there is no Westside without Louie.  It starts off discussing Louie’s youth, his discovery of the Culver City Westside Barbell club, his journey into powerlifting and his accomplishments.  You find out that Louie was (and really, still is) a badass, and definitely earned his place in the sport.  Not much time is spent discussing the methods of Westside, but really more the stuff that most people wanna hear about: the drama.  You hear stories of some big names in the bygone era of powerlifting before youtube, where most info read about in Powerlifting USA or through stories passed on in clubs.  If you follow the sport, it’s cool to hear some indepth stories about these legends.  If you’re new to it, it’s great to get acquainted with the forefathers.  The film tracks Westside all the way to its current form, detailing its domination through the 90s and early 2000s to its relative obscurity in the raw era of powerlifting. 

This film REALLY could have been better understood to be “Louie Simmons vs the World”, because he is the key and central focus of the film here.  Other folks get interviewed, and you hear some perspective from current and former Westsiders, but Louie IS the show of this film.  However, you do get to hear a few cool things regarding the evolution of the methods, why Louie did what he did, and his thought process.



**THE GOOD**




* Ron Perlman is a delightful narrator, and allows the story to flow through very naturally.



* As stated above, you get to hear some cool stories about lifters from yesteryear.  I was familiar with what an accomplished lifter Matt Dimel was, but I had no idea how psychotic he was in and out of the gym.  Hearing more about Chuck V is always worthwhile too.  Many of these guys had larger than life myths about them, and getting to see behind the scenes is awesome for fans of the sport.



* Pacing is solid.  I didn’t find myself wanting to break away from the film out of boredom at any point. 



* Louie provides a fantastic role model of a total force of nature as it relates to getting and making people stronger.  The interviews completely solidify this.  As well, you get a peek at what was going on behind the scenes at Westside, and discover that the rumors were all true.  You also get some interesting perspectives as well.  For as much as Brandon Lilly talked about being a “Westside Lifter”, I never realized he only trained at the gym for a year before being kicked out.



**THE BAD**


* This film simply cannot live up to its own hype.  And that’s an unfortunate problem created by its production, but kickstarters have been waiting since Jan 2018 (when it was originally promised to be released).  During that time, we’ve seen the updates over e-mail, promises, rave reviews at screenings across the US, and just tons and tons of drama as the movie FINALLY was released in digital form…all for what is, by all accounts, simply a good movie.  This would readily find a solid place in Netlfix’s bin of decent documentaries on fringe sports.



* I would have enjoyed more time spent focusing on the actual methods of the gym.  How they came about, why, static they faced for introducing them, etc.  Kickstarter backers are supposed to get physical DVDs that go into how to implement the conjugate method, and I’ll review them once I get them, but still, this was primarily a dramapiece, which isn’t shocking for powerlifting.



* No subtitle option from what I can tell.  Louie only has 13 teeth and speaks in a jumble many times, and I had to go back a few times and try to hear what he was saying.  The music occasionally makes this an issue too.



**SHOULD YOU BUY IT?**


If you are an old fan of powerlifting, I’d say it’s worth the current $10 pricetag.  If you followed the sport during the WPO era, you know all these names, heard these stories, and will most likely get something out of it.  If you just joined in during the raw era, I honestly can’t imagine you’ll find much of this terribly interesting.  If you don’t know the sport at all, I’m not too sure how much appeal it will have for you.  You could spend 90 minutes doing something worse than watching this film, but I can’t imagine it will appeal to anyone but the most hardcore of powerlifting nerds.",powerlifting,"[FILM REVIEW] Westside vs The World Hey folks, first, full disclosure: I wrote the below review primarily for a non-powerlifting familiar audience.  If it feels condescending, please don't interpret it that way.  

I backed the kickstarted for the movie “Westside Vs the World” and, as a result I got an advanced digital download.  For those completely unaware, this was an independent film chronicling the history of the Westside Barbell powerlifting club.  Also for those unaware, the release of this film was mired in as much drama as anything powerlifting related could be, to include having its release date pushed back indefinitely after one of the developers of the film split from the production crew, stole all the kickstarter funds, used the money to buy drugs with intent to sell before getting arrested, resulting in the original film creator having to sue that individual to get back the kickstarter funds along with screenings of the film held in gyms all over the country in order to help replenish lost funds.  A good amount of us backing the film had pretty much resigned ourselves to the fact that we’d never actually get our copies, and many disparaging things were said about the film and its creators.  I myself equated it to the “Duke Nuke ‘em Forever” of powerlifting.  But then, finally, the day had arrived and I got my early release digital copy of the film.

**Meet Prep**

The main focus of this meet prep was to give myself the best possible chance of hitting a 500 Wilks on meet day. This was likely going to be something along the lines of a ~1920 lb total at a bodyweight of a little over 260 lbs. A big reach goal of mine that I set a while ago was to break a 500 Wilks while I was still a junior and this meet being 3 days before I turn 24 meant that it was my last shot at doing so.

The biggest difference in this prep was that I did almost all of my training in my garage, which I recently converted into a home gym. The main game changers are a combo rack, calibrated kg plates, and competition power and deadlift bars. This really allowed me to perfect technique on competition grade equipment, whereas in previous training cycles, I trained with equipment that was slightly different than competition spec and it was sometimes difficult to determine exactly how much I would benefit from a stiffer squat/bench bar, a grippier bench, and a deadlift bar. I think that training at home definitely allowed me to train closer to my true maxes.

I run an 8-day split, which includes a heavy squat and deadlift day, a lighter/volume bench day, a lighter/volume squat and deadlift day, and a heavy bench day with off days every other day. I guess this is sort of similar to rotating max effort and dynamic effort days, but I much prefer extra volume and accessory work to speed work. Most days, I come into a training session with a general idea of what I want to accomplish and then tweak the reps/sets/weight/accessories depending on how I feel. Here’s a rough outline of my 4 training days with notes about why I decide to do things the way that I do.  
.  
.  
- *Heavy Squat and Deadlift Day - approx 3 hrs 30 min*

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back Squat (High Bar, Knee Wraps) | 3-4 | 1-4 | 595-700 lbs | Increased intensity and decreased repetitions gradually over about 3 months. Since these are essentially overload squats, I didn't want to rush into extremely heavy weights without my body getting used to supporting the heavier loads. My top set progression for my wrapped workouts was 595x3, 606x3, 617x4, 644x3, 661x2, 672x2, 701x1, 716x1, 661x2, 683x1.
Conventional Deadlift | 4-6 | 1-5 | 595-730 lbs | Increased intensity gradually and alternated weekly between heavy single/doubles and slightly lighter triples or lighter sets of 5 to avoid hitting high percentage singles every single week. Sometimes if I didn't feel too fried, I might keep intensity high two or three weeks in a row, but it would always catch up to me and I'd have to go back down to 80% or so for a week before hitting heavy weights again. I tried to use mixed grip for all my heavy singles, but use straps for all of my rep work. I'v never failed a competition deadlift due to grip and I start to feel imbalanced if I do too much training with a mixed grip. Straps also keep my hands happier.
Trap Bar Deadlift | 3 | 6 | 500 lbs | Used these to add variation and accumulate a little more deadlift volume without taxing the lower back as much as a barbell deadlift would. In the past, I've done deficit barbell deadlifts or deadlifts against bands here, but I really like the trap bar and wanted to see how it help my squat and deadlift. I did it mainly as a deadlift accessory, but it's not far from a half squat type movement, so I imagine that I got some carryover to the top half of my wrapped squat, too.
Walking DB Lunges | 4-5 | 8 per leg | 60 lbs per hand | Used these as a way to get more direct leg work in. Lunges are a lot easier on my knees than squats and I think its good to have some single leg work. I prefer dumbbells in each hand to a weight on my back because even though the weights are light, might as well get the extra grip work. I also like to hold a slight shrug thoughout the entire set and maintain as upright of a torso as I can. In the past, I've used dumbbell step ups for a similar purpose to lunges, but ultimately prefer lunges.
Ab Wheel | 3 | 12-20 | bodyweight | The stronger I get, the more I realize how important it is to have a strong core. I probably should be doing even more core work, but getting around 50 reps of ab wheel rollouts twice a week has helped me maintain posture under heavy loads pretty well. I think weighted planks are fantastic too, but got a little lazy and dropped them out of this training cycle.
Dumbbell Curl | 3 | 10 per arm | 40 lbs | My effort to not completely neglect biceps. Focus on squeezing my biceps at the top of the movement and getting those pinkies up! I see plenty of people go too heavy on bicep curls as they're obviously an easy lift for the ego to come into play, but I find that a controlled movement with manageable weight yields better results.

.  
.  
- *Lighter/Volume Bench Day - approx 2 hrs 45 min*

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barbell Bench Press | 4-7 | 6 | 330 lbs | Usually started with 4x6 paused bench, then sometimes added in triples with extra long pauses. In the past, I think my bench plateaued a few times when I was trying to keep intensity high every single bench workout, so I tried to have more conservative bench workouts after my heavy days this time around. These sets were always performed with very strict pauses and form.
Seated Strict Press | 5 | 5 | 170 lbs | I'm not a very strong overhead presser, but thought it would be helpful to incorporate more shoulder work during this prep to help get my bench moving. Had to do these seated, straddling my bench and facing my rack beacuse my ceiling isn't high enough to do them standing.
Dumbbell Bench | 4 | 8-12 | 115 lbs | I was dumbbell benching long before barbell benching, so I like to keep these in my training. I think its good to have to stabilize each arm individually and I like to diversify my flat pressing a little bit. 
Dumbbell Floor Press | 4 | 10-12 | 90 lbs | This is one of two exercises that I used to help the top half of my bench during this prep. I usually go a little lighter for these than I do for regular or incline dumbbell bench. I try to move the weight as fast as possible with these to practice explosive lockouts.
Tricep Bands | 4 | 25 | light bands | Unfortunately, my home gym doesn't yet have any kind of cable system, so I just did these to try to make up for the rope pressdowns that I usually would do at the end of bench workouts when I'm at a gym. I used a couple of my thinner EliteFTS bands, wrapped them around a barbell in my rack and stood back as far as I could while still being able to do 25 reps.

- *Lighter/Volume Squat and Deadlift Day - approx 3 hrs 15 min*

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back Squat (High Bar) | 4 | 6 | 418 lbs | The 4x6 scheme seemed to work well for my volume workout during my last meet prep, so I kept it in again this time around. Weight went up to 418 lbs from 405 lbs during last prep. These are meant to be pretty easy, but ensure that I get about 25 quality reps with moderate weight so I don't lose the groove from having such low squat volume on my heavy days. I also do sets up 6 warming up to these sets for another 24-30 reps.
Chin Up | 4-5 | 8 | bodyweight | I superset these with my squat warm ups. I have a Perfect Pull Up bar with rotating handles that I like to use since I don't have a rack with the pull up grips that I like at home. At a gym, I would usually get closer to 80 pull ups/chins up during this workout, but doing them in my garage is kind of a pain because my bar is so low that my knees graze the ground at the bottom of a pull up. I also don't trust the door frame enough to do these weighted, though I would like to get back into weighted pull ups sometime soon. My somewhat recent best set is 19 pull ups at around 260 lbs bodyweight, so these sets aren't very hard.
Dumbbell Row | 4 | 8-12 | 125 lbs | I superset these with my working sets of squats. I haven't done these in a while, but wanted to get back to more horizontal pulling. I also wanted to develop my rear delts more because my front delts overpower them by quite a bit.
Sumo Deadlift | 4 | 6 | 507 lbs | I used a stiff bar for these even though my conventional training is on a deadlift bar. I don't like how much the weights bounce around when pulling relatively light weight on a deadlift bar for a bunch of reps and prefer to hold myself to the standard of a stiff bar anyway (the exception being deadlifting with a deadlift bar for my conventional work during this prep because that's what I would be competing on). I generally think that opposite stance deadlifting can be very beneficial. Just because you aren't built for the other stance or don't like it, doesn't mean that it can't help your preferred/competition stance. Sumos help build my lockout, work on mobility, train my upper back slightly differently, and are easier on my lower back than conventional so I don't burn myself out. Again, these are pretty easy, but the volume really adds up to some decent gains over time. I haven't tested recently, but I would guess that my sumo is somewhere in the upper 600s, maybe even 700 lbs by now.
RDL | 3 | 8 | 308 lbs | I do RDLs mainly for hamstring development, but also to reinforce upper back positioning. I think that most other people who do RDLs do them with a higher percentage of their max deadlift, but with all the deadlift and squat volume that I do, I don't think my lower back could take heavy RDLs each week.
Walking DB Lunges | 4-5 | 8 per leg | 60 lbs per hand | See above
Ab Wheel | 3 | 12-20 | bodyweight | See above
Dumbbell Curl | 3 | 10 per arm | 40 lbs | See above

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barbell Bench Press | 5-6 | 1-4 | 375-425 lbs | I like benching with at least 88-95% intensity weights at least once a week to keep working on technique at heavier weights. I think that this lead to some slow, but very smooth high intensity sets because I got used to powering through sticking points without misgrooving. Similar to squats and deadlifts, I gradually ramped up the weight of my top sets throughout meet prep.
More Barbell Bench Press | 3-4 | 4-6 | 308-352 lbs | I liked practicing really clean pauses and explosive lifts after my heavy work to keep hammering away at form and to get more volume in. In the past, I've done wide grip instead of regular grip for these, but my shoulders never liked the wide grip so I switched back to my regular width (pinkies on the rings).
Seated Strict Press | 5 | 5 | 170 lbs | See above
Incline Dumbbell Bench | 5 | 8-12 | 115 lbs | This is my favorite bench accessory. I've never felt very comfortable doing incline barbell bench, but incline dumbbell bench just feels so natural. I use it to get extra chest, shoulder, and tricep work in after my main lifts.
Pin Press | 4-5 | 5 | 242 lbs | I did these with a slow eccentric and explosive concentric. I alternated these with the dumbbell floor press in my other bench workout because I identified the middle of the bench press range of motion as my weak point and I thought that those two exercises would help combat that. Turns out they did a pretty good job!

**Weigh Ins and Meet Day**

The meet was about 6 hrs from where I live, so I drove down the day before weigh ins. I weighed in the morning before the meet at 118.4 kg/261.0 lbs. I took a hot bath the night before and morning of weigh ins, but didn’t do a serious weight cut. This was about 4 lbs lighter than I had been regularly waking up at. Rehydrated and ate nonstop after weigh ins and went to bed a little over 270 lbs. I was back to around 266 the morning of the meet. Openers were set at a 655 lb squat, 407 lb bench, and 677 lb deadlift. The plan was to jump to 700-705 lbs for a second squat, and 727-738 for a third squat. Bench second attempt was going to be 429 lbs with a 446 third attempt and 458 fourth attempt to break a record by half a kilo if I was successful on my third. If I hit 733 for my third squat and 446 for my third bench, I was going to bump up my deadlift opener by 5 lbs then take a 50 lb jump to 733 for a 500.0 Wilks on my second attempt, giving me room to push my third deadlift a little higher. If I failed my 3rd squat or bench, I was going to stay conservative on deadlifts and shoot for a 500 Wilks by hitting 750-755 lbs on my third attempt.  
.  
.  

*Squats:*

My best training squat was a single at [716 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BepKDmelAJM/?taken-by=dylliemays). Based on that and some of my other heavy training sets, I knew I was good for at least 727 lbs. After tuning in to a little bit of the livestream from the previous day’s lifters, I saw a fair number of lifters getting red lights for depth. I’ve never had a single red light on a squat in 7 competitions worth of squats so far, but as usual I was a tiny bit nervous about depth.   

* 1st Attempt: 655 lbs. We used a 20 kg bar on our platform and even though this lift felt quick and easy, I could already feel a considerable amount of bar whip. No problems with depth and this lift was a solid confidence booster. As I took off my wraps, I did notice my left calf starting to cramp up. It was moderately uncomfortable for the rest of the meet, but fortunately didn’t seem to affect any of my lifts.  

* 2nd Attempt: 705 lbs. Our flight only had 10 lifters in it and with a couple people already timing out on their attempts, the flight was really moving quick. By the time I had entered my next attempt, rolled my knee wraps up and taken a seat, there was only about 2-3 minutes before I had to start wrapping for my next attempt. This lift really had to fly if I wanted to take a shot at 738 for a third attempt. It moved well and I didn’t slow down much through my sticking point, but I felt like 738 would be a little too ambitious at this point.  

* 3rd Attempt: 733 lbs. My hands/forearms started cramping as I was finishing up wrapping my right knee, but thankfully I was able to barely get the wraps on in time. The weight didn’t feel overly heavy on my back when I unracked it, but again the bar whip was really working against me. This turned out to be one of the bigger fights I’ve ever had with a squat, especially towards the top of the lift, where I’m typically the strongest, but I think this was a solid attempt selection. Three white lights brought me up to 8 consecutive meets worth of all white lights on squats.  

.  
.  
*Bench:*

I really enjoyed having a better equipment setup for bench this training cycle. I was able to get a much more stable base and even though I didn’t have hand offs, I could set the rack to a height that made doing self liftoffs relatively easy. Towards the end of my meet prep, I was consistently grinding out bench singles around [430-435 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeOr5hPFXcQ/?taken-by=dylliemays) so my goal was 446 lbs to set a 2.5 kg meet PR and build my total. I’d hoped to be closer to 450 lbs with my training singles, but never made it quite that high, though I did do a few sets with a slingshot up to about 470 lbs towards the end of meet prep. I also improved my training 1RM, 2RM, and 3RM by about 8 lbs each (all without handoffs) so I knew I had to be stronger than last meet prep.

* 1st Attempt: 407 lbs. This was 5 lbs over my heaviest triple in training and moved really well. As usual, this was a good confidence booster, but I already knew it would be an easy lift.

* 2nd Attempt: 429 lbs. I’d already made up my mind for what this attempt would be going into the meet. This was just supposed to be a stepping stone to 446 lbs and it went up easier than expected, so I was feeling good going into my third attempt.

* 3rd Attempt: 446 lbs. Again, this decision was made before I even started benching because I needed this weight to build my total and be able to cross the 500 Wilks barrier with my second deadlift. Pleasantly surprised that this came up quicker than expected. It felt great to be on track for my Wilks goal, and I decided that I might as well take a shot at a 4th attempt.

* 4th Attempt: 458 lbs. I originally thought that it would be pretty unlikely that I would be able to hit this weight, but knew that even if I failed it, it wouldn’t take much out of my deadlift so might as well give it a try. I only had about 3-4 minutes rest because my third attempt was near the end of my flight, but there was nothing to lose! It felt like I was pressing this for about 30 seconds, but somehow I was able to lock it out. I think that the pin pressing and dumbbell floor pressing from training really paid off here. At this point I pretty much had no doubt that I was going to finish the day 10/10.  
.  
.  

*Deadlift:*

Though my wrapped squat has definitely done some catching up recently, deadlifts have always been my best (and probably favorite) lift. My heaviest training deadlift was 750 lbs after some heavy squats. I was disappointed to fail 755 lbs at my last meet, so at the bare minimum, that was the number to beat. This was the first meet prep where I was able to train with a deadlift bar, and being able to acclimate to the extra whip of the bar was really helpful. I’m learning more and more that heavy deadlifts take forever to recover from and that I really need almost two weeks to recover from my last real deadlift workout in training to be 100% on meet day.


* 1st Attempt: 683 lbs. I bumped this up by 5 lbs after being successful on my earlier lifts so that I wouldn’t have more than a 50 lb jump to 733 lbs on my second attempt to hit a 500 Wilks. I knew this would be an easy lift because my last warm up at 628 lbs felt like I could have done it for a set of 8. My body still felt surprisingly fresh here even after the tough squat earlier.

* 2nd Attempt: 733 lbs. Easy enough! Broke a 500 Wilks! I knew I had a lot more in me here, but would have been really disappointed if I overshot my third attempt and ruined an otherwise perfect day so far. I decided on 760 lbs to hit a decent meet PR (previous best was 744 at a USAPL meet about a year before) and keep building my total.

* 3rd Attempt: 760 lbs. This felt heavy in my hands, but moved faster than I thought it would. Not sure if I’m approaching the current limit of my grip strength or if wrapping my own knees might have hurt my grip by the end of the meet. Either way, it didn’t feel like I could hold this for very long at the top. The judges asked if I wanted to take a 4th attempt and it was very tempting as I think I may have had 770 lbs in me, but I only would have been given about 4 minutes to rest and I was perfectly content to end the day on a high note without risking adding in a missed lift or possibly even injuring myself.  
.  
.  

**Thoughts**

Overall, this was possibly my most successful meet yet, especially in terms of executing the exact plan that I laid out for myself. I finished with a 880 kg/1940 lb total for a 507.58 Wilks. Just so happened that the only other classic raw lifter with a Wilks score above 470 or so finished with a Wilks of 507.66, beating me by less than a tenth of a point. I could have added 0.5 kg to any of my third attempts or weighed in 100 grams lighter, but since my deadlift flight finished before his deadlifts even started on the other platform, there was no way that I could have known how close it was going to be. The two lifters that impressed me the most were Boris Terry and Aaron Terry (who are apparently unrelated). Boris won the classic raw best lifter with a 1900ish total at 242 and Aaron won the raw best lifter with a pretty crazy 1930ish total at 242 in just sleeves. Both were very humble and very strong.

I also want to give a shout out to the entire USPA crew. This meet was extremely well organized and ran very smoothly. There was plenty of warm up space, plenty of calibrated plates and combo racks to warm up on, the spotters and loaders were moving at light speed, the single announcer kept up with both platforms with no problems, and the entire meet staff just came off as extremely competent. Though I wasn’t used to a meet going by so fast (I think the two flights on my platform finished an entire meet in just over 4 hours), I liked the pace and that there wasn’t hours of downtime between lifts. 

Turns out there aren’t very many drug tested/classic raw/125 kg/junior lifters so I was able to make a pretty big dent on the record book. Assuming I read the existing records correctly, I think that I broke 22 records for various combinations of squat/bench/deadlift/total, junior/open, full power/deadlift only, state/national, and tested/untested. I totally admit that quite a few of them had relatively low numbers to beat, but somebody has to start filling out the books!
.  
.  
**Next Steps**

My body needs a break before another serious meet prep, but I think the next plan is to take a stab at a 2000 lb total. I’m thinking about going for it at the Drug Test IPL World Championships in Vegas later this year. For those that haven’t heard, the USPA is sponsoring the top 6 men and women based on qualifying Wilks scores for that meet to represent team USA and I think it would be pretty cool to be a part of that if possible, though there is probably a good chance of my current Wilks being bumped out of the top 6 by the time all of the qualifying meets take place. I’m also thinking about taking an extra long off season or maybe doing a meet in sleeves before my shot at 2k to make sure that I’m building up to that total the right way instead of overexerting myself. Patience and consistency are key!

**Meet Prep**

The main focus of this meet prep was to give myself the best possible chance of hitting a 500 Wilks on meet day. This was likely going to be something along the lines of a ~1920 lb total at a bodyweight of a little over 260 lbs. A big reach goal of mine that I set a while ago was to break a 500 Wilks while I was still a junior and this meet being 3 days before I turn 24 meant that it was my last shot at doing so.

The biggest difference in this prep was that I did almost all of my training in my garage, which I recently converted into a home gym. The main game changers are a combo rack, calibrated kg plates, and competition power and deadlift bars. This really allowed me to perfect technique on competition grade equipment, whereas in previous training cycles, I trained with equipment that was slightly different than competition spec and it was sometimes difficult to determine exactly how much I would benefit from a stiffer squat/bench bar, a grippier bench, and a deadlift bar. I think that training at home definitely allowed me to train closer to my true maxes.

I run an 8-day split, which includes a heavy squat and deadlift day, a lighter/volume bench day, a lighter/volume squat and deadlift day, and a heavy bench day with off days every other day. I guess this is sort of similar to rotating max effort and dynamic effort days, but I much prefer extra volume and accessory work to speed work. Most days, I come into a training session with a general idea of what I want to accomplish and then tweak the reps/sets/weight/accessories depending on how I feel. Here’s a rough outline of my 4 training days with notes about why I decide to do things the way that I do.  
.  
.  
- *Heavy Squat and Deadlift Day - approx 3 hrs 30 min*

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back Squat (High Bar, Knee Wraps) | 3-4 | 1-4 | 595-700 lbs | Increased intensity and decreased repetitions gradually over about 3 months. Since these are essentially overload squats, I didn't want to rush into extremely heavy weights without my body getting used to supporting the heavier loads. My top set progression for my wrapped workouts was 595x3, 606x3, 617x4, 644x3, 661x2, 672x2, 701x1, 716x1, 661x2, 683x1.
Conventional Deadlift | 4-6 | 1-5 | 595-730 lbs | Increased intensity gradually and alternated weekly between heavy single/doubles and slightly lighter triples or lighter sets of 5 to avoid hitting high percentage singles every single week. Sometimes if I didn't feel too fried, I might keep intensity high two or three weeks in a row, but it would always catch up to me and I'd have to go back down to 80% or so for a week before hitting heavy weights again. I tried to use mixed grip for all my heavy singles, but use straps for all of my rep work. I'v never failed a competition deadlift due to grip and I start to feel imbalanced if I do too much training with a mixed grip. Straps also keep my hands happier.
Trap Bar Deadlift | 3 | 6 | 500 lbs | Used these to add variation and accumulate a little more deadlift volume without taxing the lower back as much as a barbell deadlift would. In the past, I've done deficit barbell deadlifts or deadlifts against bands here, but I really like the trap bar and wanted to see how it help my squat and deadlift. I did it mainly as a deadlift accessory, but it's not far from a half squat type movement, so I imagine that I got some carryover to the top half of my wrapped squat, too.
Walking DB Lunges | 4-5 | 8 per leg | 60 lbs per hand | Used these as a way to get more direct leg work in. Lunges are a lot easier on my knees than squats and I think its good to have some single leg work. I prefer dumbbells in each hand to a weight on my back because even though the weights are light, might as well get the extra grip work. I also like to hold a slight shrug thoughout the entire set and maintain as upright of a torso as I can. In the past, I've used dumbbell step ups for a similar purpose to lunges, but ultimately prefer lunges.
Ab Wheel | 3 | 12-20 | bodyweight | The stronger I get, the more I realize how important it is to have a strong core. I probably should be doing even more core work, but getting around 50 reps of ab wheel rollouts twice a week has helped me maintain posture under heavy loads pretty well. I think weighted planks are fantastic too, but got a little lazy and dropped them out of this training cycle.
Dumbbell Curl | 3 | 10 per arm | 40 lbs | My effort to not completely neglect biceps. Focus on squeezing my biceps at the top of the movement and getting those pinkies up! I see plenty of people go too heavy on bicep curls as they're obviously an easy lift for the ego to come into play, but I find that a controlled movement with manageable weight yields better results.

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barbell Bench Press | 4-7 | 6 | 330 lbs | Usually started with 4x6 paused bench, then sometimes added in triples with extra long pauses. In the past, I think my bench plateaued a few times when I was trying to keep intensity high every single bench workout, so I tried to have more conservative bench workouts after my heavy days this time around. These sets were always performed with very strict pauses and form.
Seated Strict Press | 5 | 5 | 170 lbs | I'm not a very strong overhead presser, but thought it would be helpful to incorporate more shoulder work during this prep to help get my bench moving. Had to do these seated, straddling my bench and facing my rack beacuse my ceiling isn't high enough to do them standing.
Dumbbell Bench | 4 | 8-12 | 115 lbs | I was dumbbell benching long before barbell benching, so I like to keep these in my training. I think its good to have to stabilize each arm individually and I like to diversify my flat pressing a little bit. 
Dumbbell Floor Press | 4 | 10-12 | 90 lbs | This is one of two exercises that I used to help the top half of my bench during this prep. I usually go a little lighter for these than I do for regular or incline dumbbell bench. I try to move the weight as fast as possible with these to practice explosive lockouts.
Tricep Bands | 4 | 25 | light bands | Unfortunately, my home gym doesn't yet have any kind of cable system, so I just did these to try to make up for the rope pressdowns that I usually would do at the end of bench workouts when I'm at a gym. I used a couple of my thinner EliteFTS bands, wrapped them around a barbell in my rack and stood back as far as I could while still being able to do 25 reps.

Exercise | Typical Working Sets | Typical Reps Per Set | Typical Weight | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Back Squat (High Bar) | 4 | 6 | 418 lbs | The 4x6 scheme seemed to work well for my volume workout during my last meet prep, so I kept it in again this time around. Weight went up to 418 lbs from 405 lbs during last prep. These are meant to be pretty easy, but ensure that I get about 25 quality reps with moderate weight so I don't lose the groove from having such low squat volume on my heavy days. I also do sets up 6 warming up to these sets for another 24-30 reps.
Chin Up | 4-5 | 8 | bodyweight | I superset these with my squat warm ups. I have a Perfect Pull Up bar with rotating handles that I like to use since I don't have a rack with the pull up grips that I like at home. At a gym, I would usually get closer to 80 pull ups/chins up during this workout, but doing them in my garage is kind of a pain because my bar is so low that my knees graze the ground at the bottom of a pull up. I also don't trust the door frame enough to do these weighted, though I would like to get back into weighted pull ups sometime soon. My somewhat recent best set is 19 pull ups at around 260 lbs bodyweight, so these sets aren't very hard.
Dumbbell Row | 4 | 8-12 | 125 lbs | I superset these with my working sets of squats. I haven't done these in a while, but wanted to get back to more horizontal pulling. I also wanted to develop my rear delts more because my front delts overpower them by quite a bit.
Sumo Deadlift | 4 | 6 | 507 lbs | I used a stiff bar for these even though my conventional training is on a deadlift bar. I don't like how much the weights bounce around when pulling relatively light weight on a deadlift bar for a bunch of reps and prefer to hold myself to the standard of a stiff bar anyway (the exception being deadlifting with a deadlift bar for my conventional work during this prep because that's what I would be competing on). I generally think that opposite stance deadlifting can be very beneficial. Just because you aren't built for the other stance or don't like it, doesn't mean that it can't help your preferred/competition stance. Sumos help build my lockout, work on mobility, train my upper back slightly differently, and are easier on my lower back than conventional so I don't burn myself out. Again, these are pretty easy, but the volume really adds up to some decent gains over time. I haven't tested recently, but I would guess that my sumo is somewhere in the upper 600s, maybe even 700 lbs by now.
RDL | 3 | 8 | 308 lbs | I do RDLs mainly for hamstring development, but also to reinforce upper back positioning. I think that most other people who do RDLs do them with a higher percentage of their max deadlift, but with all the deadlift and squat volume that I do, I don't think my lower back could take heavy RDLs each week.
Walking DB Lunges | 4-5 | 8 per leg | 60 lbs per hand | See above
Ab Wheel | 3 | 12-20 | bodyweight | See above
Dumbbell Curl | 3 | 10 per arm | 40 lbs | See above

Barbell Bench Press | 5-6 | 1-4 | 375-425 lbs | I like benching with at least 88-95% intensity weights at least once a week to keep working on technique at heavier weights. I think that this lead to some slow, but very smooth high intensity sets because I got used to powering through sticking points without misgrooving. Similar to squats and deadlifts, I gradually ramped up the weight of my top sets throughout meet prep.
More Barbell Bench Press | 3-4 | 4-6 | 308-352 lbs | I liked practicing really clean pauses and explosive lifts after my heavy work to keep hammering away at form and to get more volume in. In the past, I've done wide grip instead of regular grip for these, but my shoulders never liked the wide grip so I switched back to my regular width (pinkies on the rings).
Seated Strict Press | 5 | 5 | 170 lbs | See above
Incline Dumbbell Bench | 5 | 8-12 | 115 lbs | This is my favorite bench accessory. I've never felt very comfortable doing incline barbell bench, but incline dumbbell bench just feels so natural. I use it to get extra chest, shoulder, and tricep work in after my main lifts.
Pin Press | 4-5 | 5 | 242 lbs | I did these with a slow eccentric and explosive concentric. I alternated these with the dumbbell floor press in my other bench workout because I identified the middle of the bench press range of motion as my weak point and I thought that those two exercises would help combat that. Turns out they did a pretty good job!

**Weigh Ins and Meet Day**

The meet was about 6 hrs from where I live, so I drove down the day before weigh ins. I weighed in the morning before the meet at 118.4 kg/261.0 lbs. I took a hot bath the night before and morning of weigh ins, but didn’t do a serious weight cut. This was about 4 lbs lighter than I had been regularly waking up at. Rehydrated and ate nonstop after weigh ins and went to bed a little over 270 lbs. I was back to around 266 the morning of the meet. Openers were set at a 655 lb squat, 407 lb bench, and 677 lb deadlift. The plan was to jump to 700-705 lbs for a second squat, and 727-738 for a third squat. Bench second attempt was going to be 429 lbs with a 446 third attempt and 458 fourth attempt to break a record by half a kilo if I was successful on my third. If I hit 733 for my third squat and 446 for my third bench, I was going to bump up my deadlift opener by 5 lbs then take a 50 lb jump to 733 for a 500.0 Wilks on my second attempt, giving me room to push my third deadlift a little higher. If I failed my 3rd squat or bench, I was going to stay conservative on deadlifts and shoot for a 500 Wilks by hitting 750-755 lbs on my third attempt.

*Squats:*

My best training squat was a single at [716 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BepKDmelAJM/?taken-by=dylliemays). Based on that and some of my other heavy training sets, I knew I was good for at least 727 lbs. After tuning in to a little bit of the livestream from the previous day’s lifters, I saw a fair number of lifters getting red lights for depth. I’ve never had a single red light on a squat in 7 competitions worth of squats so far, but as usual I was a tiny bit nervous about depth.   

* 1st Attempt: 655 lbs. We used a 20 kg bar on our platform and even though this lift felt quick and easy, I could already feel a considerable amount of bar whip. No problems with depth and this lift was a solid confidence booster. As I took off my wraps, I did notice my left calf starting to cramp up. It was moderately uncomfortable for the rest of the meet, but fortunately didn’t seem to affect any of my lifts.  

* 2nd Attempt: 705 lbs. Our flight only had 10 lifters in it and with a couple people already timing out on their attempts, the flight was really moving quick. By the time I had entered my next attempt, rolled my knee wraps up and taken a seat, there was only about 2-3 minutes before I had to start wrapping for my next attempt. This lift really had to fly if I wanted to take a shot at 738 for a third attempt. It moved well and I didn’t slow down much through my sticking point, but I felt like 738 would be a little too ambitious at this point.  

* 3rd Attempt: 733 lbs. My hands/forearms started cramping as I was finishing up wrapping my right knee, but thankfully I was able to barely get the wraps on in time. The weight didn’t feel overly heavy on my back when I unracked it, but again the bar whip was really working against me. This turned out to be one of the bigger fights I’ve ever had with a squat, especially towards the top of the lift, where I’m typically the strongest, but I think this was a solid attempt selection. Three white lights brought me up to 8 consecutive meets worth of all white lights on squats.  

.  
.  
*Bench:*

I really enjoyed having a better equipment setup for bench this training cycle. I was able to get a much more stable base and even though I didn’t have hand offs, I could set the rack to a height that made doing self liftoffs relatively easy. Towards the end of my meet prep, I was consistently grinding out bench singles around [430-435 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeOr5hPFXcQ/?taken-by=dylliemays) so my goal was 446 lbs to set a 2.5 kg meet PR and build my total. I’d hoped to be closer to 450 lbs with my training singles, but never made it quite that high, though I did do a few sets with a slingshot up to about 470 lbs towards the end of meet prep. I also improved my training 1RM, 2RM, and 3RM by about 8 lbs each (all without handoffs) so I knew I had to be stronger than last meet prep.

* 1st Attempt: 407 lbs. This was 5 lbs over my heaviest triple in training and moved really well. As usual, this was a good confidence booster, but I already knew it would be an easy lift.

* 2nd Attempt: 429 lbs. I’d already made up my mind for what this attempt would be going into the meet. This was just supposed to be a stepping stone to 446 lbs and it went up easier than expected, so I was feeling good going into my third attempt.

* 3rd Attempt: 446 lbs. Again, this decision was made before I even started benching because I needed this weight to build my total and be able to cross the 500 Wilks barrier with my second deadlift. Pleasantly surprised that this came up quicker than expected. It felt great to be on track for my Wilks goal, and I decided that I might as well take a shot at a 4th attempt.

* 4th Attempt: 458 lbs. I originally thought that it would be pretty unlikely that I would be able to hit this weight, but knew that even if I failed it, it wouldn’t take much out of my deadlift so might as well give it a try. I only had about 3-4 minutes rest because my third attempt was near the end of my flight, but there was nothing to lose! It felt like I was pressing this for about 30 seconds, but somehow I was able to lock it out. I think that the pin pressing and dumbbell floor pressing from training really paid off here. At this point I pretty much had no doubt that I was going to finish the day 10/10.  
.  
.  

*Deadlift:*

Though my wrapped squat has definitely done some catching up recently, deadlifts have always been my best (and probably favorite) lift. My heaviest training deadlift was 750 lbs after some heavy squats. I was disappointed to fail 755 lbs at my last meet, so at the bare minimum, that was the number to beat. This was the first meet prep where I was able to train with a deadlift bar, and being able to acclimate to the extra whip of the bar was really helpful. I’m learning more and more that heavy deadlifts take forever to recover from and that I really need almost two weeks to recover from my last real deadlift workout in training to be 100% on meet day.


* 1st Attempt: 683 lbs. I bumped this up by 5 lbs after being successful on my earlier lifts so that I wouldn’t have more than a 50 lb jump to 733 lbs on my second attempt to hit a 500 Wilks. I knew this would be an easy lift because my last warm up at 628 lbs felt like I could have done it for a set of 8. My body still felt surprisingly fresh here even after the tough squat earlier.

* 2nd Attempt: 733 lbs. Easy enough! Broke a 500 Wilks! I knew I had a lot more in me here, but would have been really disappointed if I overshot my third attempt and ruined an otherwise perfect day so far. I decided on 760 lbs to hit a decent meet PR (previous best was 744 at a USAPL meet about a year before) and keep building my total.

* 3rd Attempt: 760 lbs. This felt heavy in my hands, but moved faster than I thought it would. Not sure if I’m approaching the current limit of my grip strength or if wrapping my own knees might have hurt my grip by the end of the meet. Either way, it didn’t feel like I could hold this for very long at the top. The judges asked if I wanted to take a 4th attempt and it was very tempting as I think I may have had 770 lbs in me, but I only would have been given about 4 minutes to rest and I was perfectly content to end the day on a high note without risking adding in a missed lift or possibly even injuring myself.  
.  
.  

**Thoughts**

Overall, this was possibly my most successful meet yet, especially in terms of executing the exact plan that I laid out for myself. I finished with a 880 kg/1940 lb total for a 507.58 Wilks. Just so happened that the only other classic raw lifter with a Wilks score above 470 or so finished with a Wilks of 507.66, beating me by less than a tenth of a point. I could have added 0.5 kg to any of my third attempts or weighed in 100 grams lighter, but since my deadlift flight finished before his deadlifts even started on the other platform, there was no way that I could have known how close it was going to be. The two lifters that impressed me the most were Boris Terry and Aaron Terry (who are apparently unrelated). Boris won the classic raw best lifter with a 1900ish total at 242 and Aaron won the raw best lifter with a pretty crazy 1930ish total at 242 in just sleeves. Both were very humble and very strong.

I also want to give a shout out to the entire USPA crew. This meet was extremely well organized and ran very smoothly. There was plenty of warm up space, plenty of calibrated plates and combo racks to warm up on, the spotters and loaders were moving at light speed, the single announcer kept up with both platforms with no problems, and the entire meet staff just came off as extremely competent. Though I wasn’t used to a meet going by so fast (I think the two flights on my platform finished an entire meet in just over 4 hours), I liked the pace and that there wasn’t hours of downtime between lifts. 

Turns out there aren’t very many drug tested/classic raw/125 kg/junior lifters so I was able to make a pretty big dent on the record book. Assuming I read the existing records correctly, I think that I broke 22 records for various combinations of squat/bench/deadlift/total, junior/open, full power/deadlift only, state/national, and tested/untested. I totally admit that quite a few of them had relatively low numbers to beat, but somebody has to start filling out the books!
.  
.  
**Next Steps**

My body needs a break before another serious meet prep, but I think the next plan is to take a stab at a 2000 lb total. I’m thinking about going for it at the Drug Test IPL World Championships in Vegas later this year. For those that haven’t heard, the USPA is sponsoring the top 6 men and women based on qualifying Wilks scores for that meet to represent team USA and I think it would be pretty cool to be a part of that if possible, though there is probably a good chance of my current Wilks being bumped out of the top 6 by the time all of the qualifying meets take place. I’m also thinking about taking an extra long off season or maybe doing a meet in sleeves before my shot at 2k to make sure that I’m building up to that total the right way instead of overexerting myself. Patience and consistency are key!

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!

This was my first time competing at USAPL Nationals since I started powerlifting last year, and it was definitely one of the most amazing experiences ever! I was fortunate enough to have qualified for Prime Time in the 83kg weight class, and this was definitely one of the most stacked group of lifters I've ever seen. I went 7/9 overall, and achieved my goal of smashing both the USAPL national and IPF world (unofficial) deadlift records!

**Meet Prep**

Since the previous meet in July, I started receiving official programing and coaching by The Strength Athletes coach Joe Stanek. He came up with a customized 12 week program to address my weakness and teach me some of the fundamentals of powerlifting (also thanks to my gf Neha for teaching me the right way to walk out for squats a week before Nationals XD), and really made me realize just how much of a noob I am to the sport! XD Some of the changes included widening my grip for bench, actually warming up before squats, and adding in pause deadlifts to improve exploding out of lockout. The program had me training 4 times a week; squat 2 times, bench 3 times, and deadlift 2 times (including variations). This helped immensely as I previously only trained each lift once a week, and the transition between lifts sometimes caught me off guard during meets. He also programmed me using the RPE system to track progression, which was a huge change from the YOLO style of lifting I did before haha. 
Another big change for my training leading up to Nationals was getting sponsored by Convoy Strength, which is an awesome powerlifting/weightlifting gym in San Diego. This allowed me to have access to calibrated kilo plates and Ohio Power Bars to train with, and using competition equipment made the transition to meet day sooooo much more fluid and predictable. 

**Meet Day**

I flew into Orlando on Tuesday so my body could have a day to adjust before lifting on Thursday. The main difference this time was that Prime Time started lifting at night, with weigh-ins around 6pm. Joe had me bring my scale from home and match it against the competition scale on the first day so I could accurately measure myself periodically before the meet. On the morning of the meet I woke up at 82kg, so making weight wasn’t a concern. I sipped water and snacked on protein bars throughout the day, and weighed in at 82.04kg without being hungry or dehydrated. After weigh-ins I drank a Pedialyte and began snacking on Lays chips (salt to retain the fluids I'm putting back in) and protein bars. Shortly after we received the news that the flight before was going super slow, so we wouldn't be starting till around 9pm, which didn't make a huge difference and just gave everyone more time to refeed.

**SQUAT**

1st attempt 501.6lb/227.5kg

https://youtu.be/3tD99bv_kyQ

Since Joe told me that IPF judges were going to be judging the Prime Time, I knew that we needed to sink the squat. The opener felt light and flew up, and got the butterflies out. 

2nd attempt 529.1lb/240kg

https://youtu.be/4z_ytdPYtHk

Got red lighted for depth, so I knew I had to really sink the third attempt.

3rd attempt 529.1lb/240.0kg

https://youtu.be/oPrHraTV-Ek

Went to parallel then sunk some more, which made the drive out of the hole weird feeling, but came out with whites so that worked :) 

**BENCH**

1st attempt 330.7b/150kg

https://youtu.be/FPbWGW_SBLk

Bench is always my Achilles so I asked Joe for a conservative opener (this was my third attempt weight at the last meet). It felt nice and easy, and got the butterflies out.

2nd attempt 347.2lb/157.5kg

https://youtu.be/xt7uEA1tqck

New meet PR and it felt surprisingly good, finally learning how to bench haha.

3rd attempt 358.3lb/162.5kg

https://youtu.be/4Ol8ACz9VCk

This was definitely nerves. When I heard how much Joe was putting on, all I could fixate on was how I've never lifted that much in the gym before (bad YOLO lifter habits; always comparing meet lifts to how I feel during max gym lifts), and this resulted in zero leg drive and trying to power everything through. Lesson learned, and will definitely improve next time! 

**DEADLIFT**

Livestream videos with /u/megangallagher commentary :) https://www.instagram.com/p/BaUvRnMH3Nb/?taken-by=deadlift_panda

1st attempt 672.4lb/305.0kg

https://youtu.be/MlPypnfbOeE

We picked this as an easy opener that I could do anytime. This was also a way to test out the Eleiko bar (215 PSI) they were using for deadlifts compared to the Ohio Power Bars I'm used to (205 PSI). Came up fast as hell, and the bar felt like butter so I knew it was going to be a fun time :D Before deadlifts I was in 66th place out of ~140 83kg lifters, and my opener brought me up to 13th place and back in the game as the announcers said haha.

2nd attempt 707.7lb/321kg

https://youtu.be/8GPDR--BM8Q

I was dying from Geno's commentary XD Joe picked this number to strategically chip the National record, and it flew up fairly easy. This brought me up from 13th place to 9th place.

3rd attempt 749.6lb/340kg

https://youtu.be/5Y3Qa8OMusE

It all came down to this lift. Before the meet I told Joe I knew I had 750lb, and we kept that as a trump card in the back. When Dexter Jones failed his third deadlift attempt at 300kg, we saw the opportunity for a podium medal position. Making this lift would tie us at 737.5kg total, and I would win by bodyweight (he weighed in 0.2kg heavier). Joe threw the number on the board, and me being terrible at kg/lb conversions didn't know what the weight was in pounds to compare to against my gym lifts (see bench 3rd attempt), and before Joe could tell me the weight Neha jumped in and yelled at me to not worry about it and just don't stop fucking pulling XD. It was surreal walking up to the bar and seeing everyone standing on their chairs, and I couldn't stop smiling as usual. The bar broke the floor a lot easier than I expected, and flew up to lockout where it always slows down (a byproduct of the narrow sumo stance). The lockout felt like forever, and midway up the calluses on my left hand tore causing the left side to slow down and helicopter a bit forward, but I knew I couldn't let go. After what felt like an eternity, I was able to use my lats and upper back to straighten the bar out and lock out fully for three white lights. The feeling was awesome, and definitely the hardest grinder to date. This final lift brought me from 9th place to 5th place, which means that I jumped 61 places with deadlifts haha.

**Result**

Finished the meet with a 737.5kg total for 495.75 Wilks, and 5th place in the 83kg weight class behind Russel Orhii, 	Charlie Dickson, Ryan Baylark, and Sean Noriega. It was definitely an honor to lift alongside all of these strong af guys!

**Next Step**

I will be doing the Pro Deadlift invitational at the Arnold Classic in March where we will see how big of a number I can put up against the best deadlifters :) followed by the Toronto Pro Super Show in June where I will make the IPF deadlift world record official (and hopefully much higher by then) and perhaps even the record total once I learn the S and B of SBD! I will continue to work with my awesome coach Joe Stanek and the TSA team, and will continue to train at Convoy Strength with the best powerlifting fam!

* 27 years old, 150lbs

---

I ran this program after a 4 month bulk. I compete in powerlifting at 148lbs and ended up getting up to 165lbs before deciding it was time to cut again. 

* This program splits weeks, with odd weeks being more powerlifting focused and heavier weights. The even weeks were an upper/lower split, which I liked the change of pace each week. It breaks up the monotony most programs have.
* Ate at a deficit (obviously) but calorie cycled and ate at or close to maintenance during the odd weeks and a bigger deficit for the even weeks. This way I could perform better during the heavier lifting days
* Supplements: Vegan protein (no I’m not vegan, just digests better), creatine, fish oil, and vitamin D

**Results**

* While his program allows you to go for a new 1RM, he also states that unless you’re a powerlifter and have experience doing a 1RM to do an AMRAP at 90%. Although I’m a PL, I elected to just do the AMRAP because they’re more fun and I’m not competing at the moment.
* He also programs to do the AMRAP days with 1-2 days of rest in between, but I’m going out of town so I did them all on the same day, one after the other and all within 45min.
* Bodyweight: 150lbs this morning
*Squatted 455x6 reps, E1RM=528lbs (+18)
*Benched 325x3 reps, E1RM=344lbs (-16)
*Deadlifted 495x6 reps, E1RM=575lbs (+10)


**Thoughts:**

* I genuinely enjoyed this program. While my bench took a big hit, I’m really happy with how my squat and deadlift turned out all while losing weight for summer.
* The back and forth from PL weeks to upper/lower weeks made me look forward to training each week, and having 8 years under my belt it’s hard for me to stay hungry to keep getting after it
* I really liked the “Arm & Pump Day” that was optional to do on Saturdays during the PL week...takes me back to my bro lifting days when I first started
* The 4x a week was a great option for me since I was eating in a deficit. It gave me plenty of time to recover. If I were to run this on a bulk, I’d definitely do the 5-6x week program.
* 8/10 and would recommend others give it a shot. The program isn’t that expensive and it’s a nice change of pace from the other programs usually posted here.
*Not sure what I’m going to do next. Probably Simple Jackd 2.0 while on maintenance, then start bulking while running THE UNITY from Meadows and Tate, and then SBS RTF. I like incorporating more bodybuilding stuff and I want to run a Meadows program before SBS...any recommendations?

kw53jl,1610498911.0,[Program Review] Smolov Squat Routine (11 Weeks; no intro cycle) -- 155.9kg -> 195.5kg,"**NOTE:** There may be formatting errors from the template, which does not seem to work well with the RES editor. Tried to clean those up as best I could.

**Description and Context:**

**What is Smolov?**

To quote Pavel Tsatsouline's  article on [Smolov](https://www.dragondoor.com/articles/another-russian-super-cycle/),

&#x200B;

>""Either of the two four week loading blocks of the thirteen week Russian cycle pack more work than > most American squatters do in a year, no joke. You shall gain but you shall pay with sweat, blood,> and vomit, Comrade.""

As far as I can tell from trying to read the (original? link below) program in Google's translation of Russian, it is meant to *rapidly* correct for lagging squat progression in anticipation of a meet. Honestly, assuming good recovery conditions, I can't imagine anyone would fail to respond to this kind of workload.

The program is split into six stages (see link(s) for full session/set/rep tables or just Google it):

1. Introductory cycle (2 weeks) -- intended for a transition from layoff/maintenance training to accustom the lifter to the sort of work expected in the following weeks.
2. Base mesocycle (4 weeks) -- high-volume, high-frequency LP. 4x/week squatting for 36/35/35/30 reps using 70/75/80/85% of one-rep max (or adjusted training max, if you go that route), with an addition of up to 20lbs for Week 2 and up to another 10lbs for Week 3. Sessions are arranged for Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Rest during Week 4 and then test for a new 1RM, which will be used in the second loading block. Fun commentary from Pavel: ""The mad Commie who dreamed up this anti-Constitutional cycle promises that once you have survived these four weeks **your legs will turn into car jacks.**"" (emphasis mine). Admittedly, my legs have never felt as full and muscular as they did in the days of Week 4 leading up to the mid-program 1RM test.
3. ""Switching"" cycle (2 weeks) -- no heavy competition squatting, but instead a focus on speed work and a few squat negatives. I used a combination of cleans, squat negatives, and pause/myo-rep squats here.
4. Intensification mesocycle (4 weeks) --  Low- to moderate-volume, \*very\* high-intensity onslaught following the switching period using a peaking block attributed to IM Feduleyev. Sessions drop to 3x/week, but the work sets are all in the 80-90% range for Weeks 1 and 2, while Weeks 3 and 4 calls for work at 90%+. Tsatsouline notes that ""merciful coach Feduleyev"" permits a 5-7% decrease in weight as needed, provided the prescribed sets/reps are completed.
5. Taper week and competition (1 week) -- heavy working sets on Monday, light working sets on Wednesday, and a Sunday peak. Pavel points out that meets on Sunday may not be a given and offers advice on altering this week (including dropping Monday entirely), also encouraging the lifter to do whatever they feel is best for their peak week if they have the experience and self-awareness to do so.

**Why did I run Smolov?**

I have been in and out of gyms since I was 19 and a friend introduced me to barbell exercise and Stronglifts 5x5. Unfortunately, he left out important details like how not to hurt myself, how to brace properly, that later programming existed to progress past newbie gains… and despite my cleverness in a scholastic context, I was (am?) an idiot in practical terms and failed to explore anything surrounding barbell training beyond ""go do 5x5, and then do it again with more weight"". A lack of deliberate training and a poor attitude toward things like rows and deadlifts meant that I wasted *a lot* of time screwing around in the gym. Around 21 I strained something in my lower back trying to squat 345lb with half-assed bracing, avoided squats for months, and then eventually got back into things. I hurt myself again at 23 and at 26ish in pretty much the same way each time. Did I mention that I was at least book-smart?

After lockdown measures eased in my area earlier this year I got back into the gym and worked my way back up to roughly the same numbers I've always had, with -- arguably -- a little bit of improvement. I took a week off squatting after struggling for the umpteenth time to do 315lb for a triple, started looking up programs, and decided to try Smolov to break through that half-decade plateau with great vengeance and furious anger. Or possibly break my back.

**Results:**

The fun part. The program is usually presented with a claim of ""100lbs in 13 weeks"" in English publications… and I wholeheartedly believe that claim. My starting numbers and results:

* 27 October 2020: 27, M, 196.5lbs/89.3kg -- Squat of 315lb/143.2kg for 1x3 (raw, no sleeves, no belt); calculated 1RM of \~343lb/155.9kg from this, used 345lb/156.8kg for base cycle calculations.
* 30 November 2020: 201.2lb/91.5kg (measured the day before) -- 1RM of 395lb/179.5kg (raw, sleeves, no belt)
* 12 January 2021: 201.5lb/91.6kg -- 1RM of 430lb/195.5kg (raw, sleeves, belt)

Based on 430lb/195.5kg, I am reasonably confident I could have hit a grindy 440lb/200kg on my third attempt today, but the walkout felt remarkably bad and I decided not to try. I'm more than happy with the lower number.

Not the main point, but during this time I regularly went to the local protein hut to use their InBody scanner. BIA is not exceptionally accurate, but the trend lines (which are at least indicative) were monotonically increasing for estimated muscle mass and either flat or decreasing for body fat percentage… which I found pretty remarkable considering the questionable sources of my caloric surplus (e.g. my fourth days fell on Tuesday for the base cycle, and upon finishing my workout I would promptly inhale a pound of boneless wings from the Wingstop just up the street from the gym I used at that time… basically every week; I also drank a good deal of beer on various days and find it genuinely confusing that I did not blubber up).

**Alterations:**

I did not use the introductory cycle. I took a week off after ""re-training"" (as if I was training for anything) prior to starting the base cycle, having  worked my squat back up to 1x3 at 315lb/143.2kg.

I used the Smolov Jr. (nothing to do with the Russians, I think) format for the base cycle rather than the original Smolov layout (6x6, 7x5, 8x4, 10x3 in Jr. versus 4x9, 5x7, 7x5, 10x3 in Smolov), which I chose based on a lack of experience with high volume training. It still worked, and quite well.

I also dropped the weight (see above under description) on W3D1 of the intensity cycle from 90%x5x5 to 90%x3x5 + 85%x2x5, as I was feeling quite tired after three sets of 90%x5.

**Discussion:**

*Structure:*

The program is squatting. More squatting than you probably want to do, at least when looking at it for the first time. Speed variations and/or other work are intended to be mixed in for the introductory and switching periods, but the program is relatively open-ended in \*exactly\* what you do in those parts… as long as it serves the squat.

*Volume/Frequency/Loading/Intensity:*

See above (description) and consult link for exact rep/set/session spread. Generally, volume and frequency are very high for the base mesocycle, while intensity is extremely high (especially for the volume occurring in the 90%+ range during Weeks 3 and 4) during the intensification mesocycle.

*Periodisation/Progression:*

The program uses block periodization. Progression in the base cycle is strictly linear (more weight each week, weights go up session-to-session within the week). Progression in the intensification mesocycle varies between adding volume and intensity, topping out with some pretty extreme sets in Weeks 3 and 4.

The structure of the base mesocycle seemed to work out very well, especially considering my lack of prior experience with higher training volume. By the third week, the first two sessions were very reasonable even with the additional 30lbs I ended up using. The intensification mesocycle demanded effort in a way that was surprisingly manageable until Weeks 3 and 4, where the first 90%x5x5 day was absolutely brutal and required me to strip a bit of weight to finish. My favorite days of the entire program ended up being the 95%x3x4 and 95%x4x3 days in these weeks, which were demanding in terms of absolute effort, but not so much that I felt as though they were unreasonable with the strength gains up to that point -- a sharp contrast to how extreme they looked at first glance.

*Specificity:*

It seems like it would be difficult to get more specific. You do a ridiculous amount of squatting, and by the end you are much better at squatting provided that you avoid injuries/burnout. The volume and frequency offer ample chances to notice problems with form/preparation that proved useful for becoming more technically proficient at the squat than I was before the program -- and doing so quite rapidly.

*Auto-regulation:*

Not much auto-regulation aside from picking how much to add for each week of the base mesocycle and choosing whether to drop the weights a bit during the intense mesocycle. These worked well, and the program does not seem that amenable to something like an RPE-based scheme in any case.

*Fatigue Management:*

Does ""continue squatting"" count? There are days where this felt like the philosophy as far as intra-week goes -- squat or quit. Admittedly, I very rarely felt sore or worn-out in the legs after workouts for the entire program-- only toward the very end of the intensity cycle, and only mildly even then. The switching cycle functions as a deload while you work on speed with sub-maximal weight, and both blocks include a good amount of rest days between the last scheduled workouts and the 1RM/competition days. The entire cycle would be a poor choice for reset-and-repeat, but the base cycle alone feels like it could be doubled-up to good effect (and I have read numerous anecdotal accounts indicating the same, for what that's worth).

That said, I'll reiterate what every other discussion of Smolov says: recovery on a daily basis is integral to completing the program. Whether your preferred modality is eating, sleeping, and stretching gratuitously or encouraging recovery with Kabuki Strength's latest precision-milled, sharply-knurled prostate massager, better-than-decent recovery is really what seemed to make this work.

*Customisation:*

Not really. You do have some freedom in choosing how to do your speed-work during the switching period and of course you have complete discretion in what kind of bench/deadlift programming you run alongside Smolov. I often see recommendations not to deadlift while running the program (and I didn't apart from RDLs after some of the squat sessions), but it does not make that much sense for a program *specifically geared toward competition peaking* to function to the exclusion of one of the other main competitive lifts. There is some stuff about deadlift training (including instructions not to deadlift immediately after squatting) in the Russian article I mentioned earlier, but Google Translate kept giving me peculiar sentences about ""eyeliner"" and ""jumping on a goat"", so… yeah. It occurs to me now that I have a friend who speaks fluent Russian, and probably should have asked her to have a shot at deciphering that. Oh well.

**Pros:**

I love squatting, and this program commanded me to squat more than I ever have before. My obedience was paid with considerable gains in a short period, even though my recovery could have been much better than it was. Though I do not expect the gains to be \*wholly\* sustainable, I expect to do enough squatting per week (after another deload period) that I should not backslide especially far.

More than the gains, I liked the additional confidence and technical proficiency that I have gained by squatting this much and under such demanding conditions. My squat looks and feels much better than it ever has. I no longer worry about whether I'm going to tweak my lower back when getting under a barbell -- I instead run through the simple mental checklist of positioning, breathing, bracing, etc. that I never previously had the experience to comfortably assemble.

**Cons:**

I'd like to get into competing at some point, and at 27 I imagine that I will be doing so more for my own gratification than anything else. That said, I want to develop a total that I would be happy with putting up, especially since I do not anticipate competing until the state of the world due to the pandemic improves a bit. Taking two months off the deadlift to squat like a mad Cossack is not exactly conducive to a good total, so I do look forward to moving on if only for the chance to progress in the main lifts in a more balanced way.

**Recommendations:**

If you do not love the squat, Smolov isn't likely to help with that very much. If you feel like you *could* love the squat, it might help you develop the relationship of your dreams. If you want a *better* squat and wish for your legs to ""turn into car jacks"", Smolov does a damn fine job of driving up the number on the bar in a very short time -- assuming you take it seriously, maintain good form, and recover well.

I think it would pay to figure out a good deadlift routine to use during the program (see my rationale above) so as to leave less on the table in terms of overall gains. My deadlift *did* go up a bit, but I've also lost specific skill (and some grip strength) for simply having not pulled more than two days in the last 11 weeks. That will correct over the longer term as I reintegrate deadlifts in my training, but I imagine I could have done better by the pull.

**Conclusion:**

Smolov's reputation as a difficult yet effective program is well-deserved, although the difficulty as presented in English publications seems… slightly exaggerated. At least in my experience, doing the prescribed work and emphasizing recovery (even if not optimally, as in my case) drives tangible, rapid progress throughout the program. The risk of overuse injury is certainly real with the kind of volume present in the base cycle, but good form and intelligent choices regarding starting 1RM and weekly load increases should make that risk manageable. The intensity cycle, while demanding, tracks likewise. It was a very enjoyable experience seeing that the rapid gains from the base cycle did not just evaporate and leave me struggling to complete sessions week after week; rather, I became significantly stronger and more technically proficient in the squat in a relatively short time.

I think that this is worth trying. I certainly got a lot out of it.

*Specificity:*

It seems like it would be difficult to get more specific. You do a ridiculous amount of squatting, and by the end you are much better at squatting provided that you avoid injuries/burnout. The volume and frequency offer ample chances to notice problems with form/preparation that proved useful for becoming more technically proficient at the squat than I was before the program -- and doing so quite rapidly.

*Auto-regulation:*

Not much auto-regulation aside from picking how much to add for each week of the base mesocycle and choosing whether to drop the weights a bit during the intense mesocycle. These worked well, and the program does not seem that amenable to something like an RPE-based scheme in any case.

*Fatigue Management:*

Does ""continue squatting"" count? There are days where this felt like the philosophy as far as intra-week goes -- squat or quit. Admittedly, I very rarely felt sore or worn-out in the legs after workouts for the entire program-- only toward the very end of the intensity cycle, and only mildly even then. The switching cycle functions as a deload while you work on speed with sub-maximal weight, and both blocks include a good amount of rest days between the last scheduled workouts and the 1RM/competition days. The entire cycle would be a poor choice for reset-and-repeat, but the base cycle alone feels like it could be doubled-up to good effect (and I have read numerous anecdotal accounts indicating the same, for what that's worth).

That said, I'll reiterate what every other discussion of Smolov says: recovery on a daily basis is integral to completing the program. Whether your preferred modality is eating, sleeping, and stretching gratuitously or encouraging recovery with Kabuki Strength's latest precision-milled, sharply-knurled prostate massager, better-than-decent recovery is really what seemed to make this work.

*Customisation:*

Not really. You do have some freedom in choosing how to do your speed-work during the switching period and of course you have complete discretion in what kind of bench/deadlift programming you run alongside Smolov. I often see recommendations not to deadlift while running the program (and I didn't apart from RDLs after some of the squat sessions), but it does not make that much sense for a program *specifically geared toward competition peaking* to function to the exclusion of one of the other main competitive lifts. There is some stuff about deadlift training (including instructions not to deadlift immediately after squatting) in the Russian article I mentioned earlier, but Google Translate kept giving me peculiar sentences about ""eyeliner"" and ""jumping on a goat"", so… yeah. It occurs to me now that I have a friend who speaks fluent Russian, and probably should have asked her to have a shot at deciphering that. Oh well.

**Pros:**

I love squatting, and this program commanded me to squat more than I ever have before. My obedience was paid with considerable gains in a short period, even though my recovery could have been much better than it was. Though I do not expect the gains to be \*wholly\* sustainable, I expect to do enough squatting per week (after another deload period) that I should not backslide especially far.

More than the gains, I liked the additional confidence and technical proficiency that I have gained by squatting this much and under such demanding conditions. My squat looks and feels much better than it ever has. I no longer worry about whether I'm going to tweak my lower back when getting under a barbell -- I instead run through the simple mental checklist of positioning, breathing, bracing, etc. that I never previously had the experience to comfortably assemble.

**Cons:**

I'd like to get into competing at some point, and at 27 I imagine that I will be doing so more for my own gratification than anything else. That said, I want to develop a total that I would be happy with putting up, especially since I do not anticipate competing until the state of the world due to the pandemic improves a bit. Taking two months off the deadlift to squat like a mad Cossack is not exactly conducive to a good total, so I do look forward to moving on if only for the chance to progress in the main lifts in a more balanced way.

**Recommendations:**

If you do not love the squat, Smolov isn't likely to help with that very much. If you feel like you *could* love the squat, it might help you develop the relationship of your dreams. If you want a *better* squat and wish for your legs to ""turn into car jacks"", Smolov does a damn fine job of driving up the number on the bar in a very short time -- assuming you take it seriously, maintain good form, and recover well.

I think it would pay to figure out a good deadlift routine to use during the program (see my rationale above) so as to leave less on the table in terms of overall gains. My deadlift *did* go up a bit, but I've also lost specific skill (and some grip strength) for simply having not pulled more than two days in the last 11 weeks. That will correct over the longer term as I reintegrate deadlifts in my training, but I imagine I could have done better by the pull.

**Conclusion:**

Smolov's reputation as a difficult yet effective program is well-deserved, although the difficulty as presented in English publications seems… slightly exaggerated. At least in my experience, doing the prescribed work and emphasizing recovery (even if not optimally, as in my case) drives tangible, rapid progress throughout the program. The risk of overuse injury is certainly real with the kind of volume present in the base cycle, but good form and intelligent choices regarding starting 1RM and weekly load increases should make that risk manageable. The intensity cycle, while demanding, tracks likewise. It was a very enjoyable experience seeing that the rapid gains from the base cycle did not just evaporate and leave me struggling to complete sessions week after week; rather, I became significantly stronger and more technically proficient in the squat in a relatively short time.

I think that this is worth trying. I certainly got a lot out of it.

Hey all,

I attended the Juggernaut Performance Summit yesterday in Uniondale, NY and decided to write up and share with you some of the notes I took. I've written up CWS's presentation in PPT form, as I felt it was the easiest way to organize the data. The other presentations are discussed here. I've included the entire Summit's handout as well if you are interested in reading more.

**CWS: Principle of Individual Differences**

[Link to PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ba731RFQ8_8GHoEUkozVXiKLAhYBG-QglV-RqxdjqNY/edit?usp=sharing)

This was easily the best presentation of the day. If you have ever had any questions about how to choose personalized volume and frequency, this is the one for you. 

**Dr. James Hoffman: Recovery Adaptive (RA) Principles** 

This was a decent presentation discussing many of the topics for which Dr. James is known. Some major points:

1. RA is not meant to simply return us to baseline, but to incorporate adaption beyond baseline
2. We know when we are adequately recovered when we can accomplish another overloading session
3. If we are under-recovered (over-fatigued), we cannot express a fitness train, and thus cannot train that trait
4. Preparedness is a measure of how much fitness we can express vs.  how much fatigue we've accumulated
5. Junk volume  is training that doesn't meet our MRV but still fatigues us
6. When considering macros for recovery, carbohydrates (for glycogen replenishment) are more important than protein
7. Fatigue drops off quicker than fitness decays (basically the premise behind any good peak and taper)

There are some great little pyramid charts in the linked handout which I highly suggest you look through. I was able to speak with him one-on-one after the presentation and he was very helpful in answering some research-related questions I had. 

**Max Aita: Technique Development for Weightlifting** 

I was actually a little disappointed by this one, as he didn't spend much, if any, time discussing the actually technical aspects of the lifts, but rather simply the progression of training focuses through the beginner/intermediate/advanced stages. I realize that perhaps a hands-on seminar may have been the best medium for a more technical presentation, but when the presentation is started out by saying that much of the technical language of the lifts is not standard between coaches, I'd expect at least a little explanation as to what the correct technical terms are, and where they apply throughout the lifts. I was able to ask him a question regarding the use of the olympic lifts in collegiate S&C programs; I work with a lot of college athletes in a private sector facility and I'm floored at how many lifters have cleans and snatches in their programs but cannot perform them anywhere near adequately. He (and the rest of the panel) agreed that unless the sport they are training for is olympic weightlifting, there are so many better uses of time to achieve loaded triple extension. 

**Dr. Quinn Henoch: Reducing Risk & Managing Injury for the Strength Athlete**

This was an excellent presentation, as Dr. Quinn is an excellent speaker and presenter. Much of what he discussed was about how every injury in sport is simply a matter of the external load experienced being greater than the capacity of the muscle experiencing it, whether that be a pec tearing on a bench rep or Adrian Petersen's knee absorbing that helmet. He stressed that while we can't prevent injury, we can reduce the risk. One of the neater topics he talked about was the ACWR (Acute-Chronic Workload Ratio). This is explained at length in the attached handout, but I'll attempt to describe it here as well. Basically, we take the training load of 1 week (microcycle) and divide that by the average load of the previous 4 weeks. This gives us an indicator of injury risk. If the workload of the previous 4 weeks hasn't adequately prepared us for thew rigors of the current microcycle, we are at greater risk of injury. We see this manifested as a ""spike"" in a graph of training (see the handout for an illustration of this concept). When we level out these spikes in training, we mitigate the risk of injury. Ideally, we want to see training volume at and around our MRV, with maybe one microcycle of planned (functional) overreaching. Another big topic he spoke on was programming considerations for the injured lifter. The #1 goal of training with an injury is to maintain fitness levels while healing. He gave a two-tiered approach to this: Tier 1 (the most important) involves looking at training load trends and leveling out those pesky spikes, and identifying two triggers: intensity and volume. If pain is experienced at a certain intensity threshold, go lighter. If it's experienced after a certain number of sets, cut the sets off before that point. The second tier was about movement modifications. He advised choosing top-down movement modifications (i.e. on a bench press: beginning the rep as normal and stopping right before the ROM that produces the pain). Tempo training was another Tier 2 modification; isometrics & heavy slow resistances (HSR) were two methods that had an analgesic effect on pain; he gave a HSR protocol example (in the handout) whose first 3 weeks were 3 sets of 15 at a 3-0-3 tempo. The entire audience laughed in disbelief/sympathy when we saw that. He didn't get time to go into his slides on passive mobility modalities, but if you've ever seen/heard him speak in the subject, nothing has changed: spend time going through Tier 1 and 2, focusing on moving thorugh a full ROM under a load.

**Dr. Mike Israetel: From Inspiration to Passion**

Dr. Mike's talk dealt with the six constructs (psychological tools aiding in adherence) of Inspiration, Motivation, Intention, Discipline, Habit, and Passion. His focus was on diet, but he mentioned how these constructs can obviously be applied to any other behavior we are trying to change. His specific info on each can be found on the slides; I will try to put here what he said aloud.

1. Inspiration: can be positive (I want to look like them) or negative (I hate my body); it doesn't last long (Can't have that ""just watched Rocky"" feeling every day). He spent some time slamming the Instagram ""Inspiration"" crowd which was pretty funny.
2. Motivation: A feeling; a desire to do something about a goal; less intense than inspiration, but longer lasting; ""Inspiration pushes, motivation pulls""; turns Desires into Goals
3. Intention: a COMMITMENT to actually DO something; it fills in the gaps to adherence when motivation is low; it is our plan of execution
4. Discipline: it is necessary to fulfill our intentions; it is our ""fuel""; it is the use of willpower when motivation is low; it is effective, but exhaustible
5. Habit: the more you do something, the easier it gets; it increases our chances of success at achieving our goals; it occurs as the waves of motivation (high/low) normalize; it doesn't kick in right away; it is a ""goalpost"" of adherence (gave a cool analogy of a video game checkpoint); takes 4-6 weeks to establish; it makes conditions easy and convenient; it will come with time!
6. Passion: deep affection and love for the process; not everyone can or will be passionate; it only happens when we are habitual; we cannot promise or force passion. 

There are some great graphs illustrating the constructs on the linked handout (towards the end). Also, my GF and I concluded that Dr. Mike is Patton Oswalt in a universe where he lifted. 

Some interesting goodies from the Q&A at the end:

1. There is a vegan protein called Quorn which is a mycoprotein (grown from a fermented fungal biomass). It's a complete protein, which is pretty cool!
2. Using singles outside of a peak can be useful, mainly from a psychological rather than a physiological perspective and are useful for practicing the technique of lifting a heavy single. Chad discussed how Marisa (Inda) will take heavy singles starting 10 weeks out, working up to her last heavy single with incremental loads.

**My stats:** Male, 20’s, 5'10""/178cm  

 | Bodyweight | Squat | Bench | Dead | OHP
---|---|----|----|----|----
Start | 209lb/95kg | 350lb/159kg | 230lb/105kg | 420lb/191kg | 140lb/64kg

**History:** My oncologist advised me to start lifting after chemo/radiation to combat some muscular atrophy. Ran SS for a while in early February ’14, then jumped on PHUL for 6 months [(write-up here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/2kxzjw/phul_6_months_in_review/).
    
**Goals:** The goal for this was to focus solely on powerlifting, get more practice under the bar, as well as ride out the last of my noob gains. I set my 2015 goals for a 405lb/184kg squat, 265lb/120kg bench, 500lb/227.5kg deadlift, and to compete at least once.
  
**Diet:** I started this program in a surplus and ended the bulk at around 220lb/100kg. Then I started working my way down to ~200lb/91kg. The deficit ran for nearly 8 months, much longer than I wanted, because I was traveling a lot and lacked discipline. This noticeably impacted my training. I was rarely doing my T3 work and felt like shit in general.   
  
Went back into a surplus for a few months and felt awesome. Got up to around 215lb/97kg and easily cut back down to ~205lb/93kg for a meet.  
  
Current macros are 242p/92f/242c at around 2800 calories and walking around at ~210/95kg.  
  
**Supplements**:  
•	5g creatine monohydrate daily  
•	Fish oil  
•	2000 IU Vitamin D  
•	Multivitamin  
•	Protein shakes to fill in gaps in my macros  
•	Preworkout  
  
**Training Review:** Let me preface this by saying that this is a method of training, *not* a program. It can be interpreted and configured in many different ways and this was just my take on it.  
  
Before starting, I deloaded a little bit (20lbs/10kg IIRC) on all lifts and moved from high bar to low bar squatting. I tried to mirror what Cody had described in his blog posts for first half of the year just because I had never programmed for myself before. Version one looked like this:  
  
Day 1 - T1: Squat, T2: Squat, T3: Leg Curl, Lat Pulldown  
Day 2 - T1: Bench, T2: Bench, T3: Dips, Curls  
Day 3 - T1: Deadlift, T2: Deadlift or Deficit Deadlift, T3: Pull-Ups  
Day 4 - T1: OHP, T2: Incline Bench, T3: Lateral Raise, Facepulls  
  
Typically, the 5th week was a deload since I was usually pretty beat up.  
  
I was making some good progress, but my bench was stalling really badly, OHP was slowing down, and my deadlifts were still a little slow off the floor. Deadlifts were pretty easy to fix by starting to do all of my T2 work from a deficit. For bench, I did a little bit of reading and it seemed like the general consensus is that if your bench sucks, bench  more. I reached out to Cody and asked if I would be better off switching the OHP day out for another bench day. He laid out a day where I go for different rep maxes, trying to PR every week. It is laid out in a 4-week cycle like so:  
  
T1: Set 10, 8, 6, or 4 rep max.  
T2: 75% of whatever your T1 weight was for 3 sets of max reps with 1-2 left in the tank.  
T3: Pec fly, tricep pushdown, CGBP at a weight were you would expect to fail around 15 reps.  
  
I really like it and my rep maxes and 1RM have been going up every week. Just last night I hit a [10lb bench PR](https://youtu.be/HHQKo52bNkc) with more left in the tank. I'm confident that if I ran this longer, I would continue to see increases.
 
Version two incorporates the new bench day, some weak point training in T2, and variating accessories and rehab in T3.
  
**Program Results:** I went through a job change, proposal/wedding planning, gym switch, and move during the program, so training was not as optimal as it could have been. Despite all of this, I am still **very** happy with the results. I would definitely say it is not for a beginner, but I think even an early-intermediate will gain a lot from Cody’s method. I am more confident under the bar and feel more technically proficient at the movements.  
  
This program also lead me into a meet where I [totaled 1201@205/545@93](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3syiv8/meet_report_usapl_virginia_state_championship/).  

I also made a [cool little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1giWR0MDtj4JUDSnWoj44Pff9ZO9RKNSMs3Ixh0y1KXg/edit?usp=sharing) for planning cycles that hopefully someone can get some use out of. This spreadsheet is also the final form of the program that I run today.  
  
**What I would change or do differently:** This is no one’s fault but my own, but neglecting the things that would fit into “T4,” nutrition, recovery, sleep, hydration, stress, etc., can really bite you in the ass. I ended up with some biceps tendonitis from not paying attention and was beat up all the time because I wasn’t getting the food and sleep necessary to recover.   
  
Neglecting T3 is a pretty bad idea too. As Cody has said, ""a pyramid is only as tall as its base."" I noticed a correlation between how I was feeling/progressing and if I was doing my T3 work, especially while cutting.  

Also, progressing using rep maxes rather than only progressing the training max linearly would probably keep the gain train running longer.  
  
Finally, choosing your training max conservatively will allow you to progress for longer and not fatigue you as hard. If your training max is set to a true 1RM like what I was doing, the INOL throughout the cycle will range from 1.29 to 2.97, aka insane intensity. Pick something you can hit for 2-3 reps or an RPE 8.5-9.  
  
All of this stuff can be found in Cody's blog posts, so make sure to read and re-read them if you're thinking about implementing the method for yourself.
  
**What’s next:** I've wanted to work directly with a coach and experiment with other training styles for a little while now, so I just signed up for TSA’s service and have my first consultation this week. If everything works out, I plan to run their programming for at least a few months.

EDIT Dec28 - Modified the spreadsheet to be sets x reps.",powerlifting,"[Program Review] 12 months of GZCL TL;DR: Very solid, highly customizable intermediate training method that led to a 210lb/95kg increase on my total, despite being in a deficit and traveling for a majority of training.  
  
**My stats:** Male, 20’s, 5'10""/178cm  

 | Bodyweight | Squat | Bench | Dead | OHP
---|---|----|----|----|----
Start | 209lb/95kg | 350lb/159kg | 230lb/105kg | 420lb/191kg | 140lb/64kg
End | 207lb/94kg | 435lb/197.5kg | 275lb/125kg | 500lb/227.5kg | 170lb/77kg
  
**History:** My oncologist advised me to start lifting after chemo/radiation to combat some muscular atrophy. Ran SS for a while in early February ’14, then jumped on PHUL for 6 months [(write-up here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/2kxzjw/phul_6_months_in_review/).
    
**Goals:** The goal for this was to focus solely on powerlifting, get more practice under the bar, as well as ride out the last of my noob gains. I set my 2015 goals for a 405lb/184kg squat, 265lb/120kg bench, 500lb/227.5kg deadlift, and to compete at least once.
  
**Diet:** I started this program in a surplus and ended the bulk at around 220lb/100kg. Then I started working my way down to ~200lb/91kg. The deficit ran for nearly 8 months, much longer than I wanted, because I was traveling a lot and lacked discipline. This noticeably impacted my training. I was rarely doing my T3 work and felt like shit in general.   
  
Went back into a surplus for a few months and felt awesome. Got up to around 215lb/97kg and easily cut back down to ~205lb/93kg for a meet.  
  
Current macros are 242p/92f/242c at around 2800 calories and walking around at ~210/95kg.  
  
**Supplements**:  
•	5g creatine monohydrate daily  
•	Fish oil  
•	2000 IU Vitamin D  
•	Multivitamin  
•	Protein shakes to fill in gaps in my macros  
•	Preworkout  
  
**Training Review:** Let me preface this by saying that this is a method of training, *not* a program. It can be interpreted and configured in many different ways and this was just my take on it.  
  
Before starting, I deloaded a little bit (20lbs/10kg IIRC) on all lifts and moved from high bar to low bar squatting. I tried to mirror what Cody had described in his blog posts for first half of the year just because I had never programmed for myself before. Version one looked like this:  
  
Day 1 - T1: Squat, T2: Squat, T3: Leg Curl, Lat Pulldown  
Day 2 - T1: Bench, T2: Bench, T3: Dips, Curls  
Day 3 - T1: Deadlift, T2: Deadlift or Deficit Deadlift, T3: Pull-Ups  
Day 4 - T1: OHP, T2: Incline Bench, T3: Lateral Raise, Facepulls  
  
Typically, the 5th week was a deload since I was usually pretty beat up.  
  
I was making some good progress, but my bench was stalling really badly, OHP was slowing down, and my deadlifts were still a little slow off the floor. Deadlifts were pretty easy to fix by starting to do all of my T2 work from a deficit. For bench, I did a little bit of reading and it seemed like the general consensus is that if your bench sucks, bench  more. I reached out to Cody and asked if I would be better off switching the OHP day out for another bench day. He laid out a day where I go for different rep maxes, trying to PR every week. It is laid out in a 4-week cycle like so:  
  
T1: Set 10, 8, 6, or 4 rep max.  
T2: 75% of whatever your T1 weight was for 3 sets of max reps with 1-2 left in the tank.  
T3: Pec fly, tricep pushdown, CGBP at a weight were you would expect to fail around 15 reps.  
  
I really like it and my rep maxes and 1RM have been going up every week. Just last night I hit a [10lb bench PR](https://youtu.be/HHQKo52bNkc) with more left in the tank. I'm confident that if I ran this longer, I would continue to see increases.
 
Version two incorporates the new bench day, some weak point training in T2, and variating accessories and rehab in T3.
  
**Program Results:** I went through a job change, proposal/wedding planning, gym switch, and move during the program, so training was not as optimal as it could have been. Despite all of this, I am still **very** happy with the results. I would definitely say it is not for a beginner, but I think even an early-intermediate will gain a lot from Cody’s method. I am more confident under the bar and feel more technically proficient at the movements.  
  
This program also lead me into a meet where I [totaled 1201@205/545@93](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3syiv8/meet_report_usapl_virginia_state_championship/).  

I also made a [cool little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1giWR0MDtj4JUDSnWoj44Pff9ZO9RKNSMs3Ixh0y1KXg/edit?usp=sharing) for planning cycles that hopefully someone can get some use out of. This spreadsheet is also the final form of the program that I run today.  
  
**What I would change or do differently:** This is no one’s fault but my own, but neglecting the things that would fit into “T4,” nutrition, recovery, sleep, hydration, stress, etc., can really bite you in the ass. I ended up with some biceps tendonitis from not paying attention and was beat up all the time because I wasn’t getting the food and sleep necessary to recover.   
  
Neglecting T3 is a pretty bad idea too. As Cody has said, ""a pyramid is only as tall as its base."" I noticed a correlation between how I was feeling/progressing and if I was doing my T3 work, especially while cutting.  

Also, progressing using rep maxes rather than only progressing the training max linearly would probably keep the gain train running longer.  
  
Finally, choosing your training max conservatively will allow you to progress for longer and not fatigue you as hard. If your training max is set to a true 1RM like what I was doing, the INOL throughout the cycle will range from 1.29 to 2.97, aka insane intensity. Pick something you can hit for 2-3 reps or an RPE 8.5-9.  
  
All of this stuff can be found in Cody's blog posts, so make sure to read and re-read them if you're thinking about implementing the method for yourself.
  
**What’s next:** I've wanted to work directly with a coach and experiment with other training styles for a little while now, so I just signed up for TSA’s service and have my first consultation this week. If everything works out, I plan to run their programming for at least a few months.
