72lboa,1506441671.0,The State of Bodybuilding,"Hi everybody!

I know that our bodybuilding community is having a difficult moment with the tension between the IFBB International and the IFBB Pro, and I wanted to come here to hear from all of you what your concerns and thoughts are about the current situation with our sport.

I used to give State of the State speeches every year, but for the state of bodybuilding, I'd like to just listen to you.

I know very well that bodybuilding doesn't belong to any one federation or person. It belongs to the fans and the athletes because without the champions on the stage and the people in the audience, we have absolutely nothing.

As the promoter of Arnold Classics all over the world, I keep getting asked how I feel about this IFBB split. 

The truth is, I just want our sport to succeed. I think infighting does nothing to help with that goal. We are best when we are moving forward together, no matter what federation we all come from - I myself competed in NABBA, AAU, and IFBB. I'd like nothing more than to unify the sport and end these turf wars.

You know my concerns. At the professional level, some bodybuilders look like they're starring in Junior 2, it seems the focus is on only size and not aesthetics, the art of posing is getting lost and not being judged outside the Arnold Classics, and an overdosage of drugs, and as a result, we have tremendous difficulty getting TV coverage and expanding our fan base. At the amateur level, I've heard from many athletes about restrictions on where and when they can compete and other bureaucratic red tape and a hardcore top-down approach.

So I want to hear your thoughts, concerns, and challenges. And I know many of you are athletes, so I'd like you to be as specific as possible. 

Even though we are told we have to choose one federation or another, I prefer to keep the sport unified, and I certainly don't let anyone rush me into any decisions, especially with something this close to my heart. 

I want to hear your take and I'm counting on your candid thoughts.",bodybuilding,"The State of Bodybuilding Hi everybody!

4emzud,1460572814.0,RIP /u/colonelslur :(,"So I know this isn't exactly bodybuilding-related in terms of what the sub generally allows, but I hope the mods allow this.

My friend Shiv, known in here as colonelslur, [died last night](http://wtvr.com/2016/04/12/shiv-sharma-obit/) in a horrific car crash. He was the only casualty. He was 19.

I met Shiv on here. At the time I was posting a lot more frequently and he messaged me for weight loss tips. I started him out, gave him a couple pointers, and he ended up losing something like 140 pounds. He wasn't stopping there though--he wanted to compete in men's physique, and dammit I think he could have done it if he'd had more time. If he'd had more time.

He was aesthetic as fuck, guys. Could have modeled on face alone. Body was starting to come together and he was so excited to see it happen. Every vein was celebrated, every PR was a victory from this guy that originally just needed someone to talk to. Someone to listen. He wasn't cloaked in anonymity by the Internet, he was strengthened by it. He used it to make himself better.

He was the nicest guy, too. Always asked how I was doing. Thanked me a ton for helping him long after he had to, and it was just him putting in the work. I always was impressed by his strength of character. I was always impressed by him, period.

We lost a hell of a lifter much too soon. I lost a hell of a friend much too soon. I just wanted to remember him. I just want a sort of coming-together, for who he was. Who he could have been, was on his way to becoming. He's lifting with Zyzz now.

RIP Shiv. Forever and always mirin.

Here is a recent picture of his final weight loss, and his most recent physique update I could find where he was showing off vascularity. ",bodybuilding,"RIP /u/colonelslur :( So I know this isn't exactly bodybuilding-related in terms of what the sub generally allows, but I hope the mods allow this.

My friend Shiv, known in here as colonelslur, [died last night](http://wtvr.com/2016/04/12/shiv-sharma-obit/) in a horrific car crash. He was the only casualty. He was 19.

I met Shiv on here. At the time I was posting a lot more frequently and he messaged me for weight loss tips. I started him out, gave him a couple pointers, and he ended up losing something like 140 pounds. He wasn't stopping there though--he wanted to compete in men's physique, and dammit I think he could have done it if he'd had more time. If he'd had more time.

He was aesthetic as fuck, guys. Could have modeled on face alone. Body was starting to come together and he was so excited to see it happen. Every vein was celebrated, every PR was a victory from this guy that originally just needed someone to talk to. Someone to listen. He wasn't cloaked in anonymity by the Internet, he was strengthened by it. He used it to make himself better.

He was the nicest guy, too. Always asked how I was doing. Thanked me a ton for helping him long after he had to, and it was just him putting in the work. I always was impressed by his strength of character. I was always impressed by him, period.

We lost a hell of a lifter much too soon. I lost a hell of a friend much too soon. I just wanted to remember him. I just want a sort of coming-together, for who he was. Who he could have been, was on his way to becoming. He's lifting with Zyzz now.

RIP Shiv. Forever and always mirin.

Palumbo didn't even mention the 55,000 ng/dl testosterone level.

You have well known bodybuilding channels  arguing against Luke Sandoe's  family post about it being heart disease and that it was definitely suicide. Outrageous. 

Now with Shawn Rhoden, there's this idea being pushed by bodybuilding media that it was the stress of - not- competing and that of the pending rape case that caused him to have a heart attack, and had he only be allowed to compete in the most heart - toxic sport of them all in his mid forties, he'd have been saved.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL7\_6PPvrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL7_6PPvrg)

You got Nick Tragilli talking about how careful and conservative Rhoden was with his drug use. As if we all couldnt see how he had shreds approaching that of Andreas Munzer in 2018, and as if he didn't almost bleed to death by a massive overdose of ibuprofen the year prior.

So instead of talking about the safety of athletes, what changes need to be made to prevent these hardworking bodybuilders from dropping like flies, thus saving lives, they're instead talking about what big meanies the IFBB are for not allowing a man with a pending rape case to compete. When the IFBB can do whatever they like with their own company. Rhoden wasn't owed a living by them and yet these commentators are acting like he was entitled to be on stage under the ""innocent until proven guilty"" standard, which they keep repeating - that applies to courts of law, not to businesses. And they know that.

For all their claims of being real and sharing the honest truth in bodybuilding, there's very little honesty here and its all to protect the sports image and the status quo of seeing incredibly big and ripped men and women on stage. So these tragedies will keep repeating.

He fell asleep driving and slammed headfirst into a concrete barrier, dying instantly.

If you guys are on the bigger side (>220lb) there‚Äôs like a 95% chance that you have at least moderate sleep apnea. Please, for the sake of your friends and family, go get a sleep study done and look at treatment options. Not only will your sleep quality improve dramatically, you may literally save your own life.
